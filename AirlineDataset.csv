AB Aviation,9,"""pretty decent airline""",11th November 2019,True," Moroni to Moheli. Turned out to be a pretty decent airline. Online booking worked well, checkin and boarding was fine and the plane looked well maintained. Its a very short flight - just 20 minutes or so so i didn't expect much but they still managed to hand our a bottle of water and some biscuits which i though was very nice.

AB Aviation,1,"""Not a good airline""",25th June 2019,True,"Moroni to Anjouan. It is a very small airline. My ticket advised me to turn up at 0800hrs which I did. There was confusion at this small airport. I was then directed to the office of AB Aviation which was still closed. It opened at 0900hrs and I was told that the flight had been put back to 1300hrs and that they had tried to contact me. This could not be true as they did not have my phone number. I was with a local guide and he had not been informed either. I presume that I was bumped off. The later flight did operate but as usual, there was confusion at check-in. The flight was only 30mins and there were no further problems.

Check-in was disorganised because of locals with big packages and disinterested staff. The flight was fortunately short (30 mins). Took off on time and landed on time.

Adria Airways,1,"""I will never fly again with Adria""",28th September 2019,False," Please do a favor yourself and do not fly with Adria. On the route from Munich to Pristina in July 2019 they lost my luggage and for 10 days in a row, despite numerous phone calls they were not able to locate it. 11 days later the luggage arrived at the destination completely ruined. Applying for compensation, they ignored my request. Foolishly again, I booked another flight with them (345 euros) Frankfurt - Pristina in September 2019. They cancelled the flight with no reason 24 hours before the departure. Desperate phone calls to customer service to get anything (rerouting, compensation, etc) were not responded.

For 3 straight days we tried to reach the airline and the web agent (e-dreams) and we did not get a solution. Finally, 18 hours before our cancelled flight time, and after 35 minutes on a call (waiting), the airline was able to get us on a flight with Lufthansa.

Original Route was Ljubljana to Sarajevo return. Two weeks before i received an email that the flight was cancelled. Offered route change was Ljubljana to Sarajevo via Munich. Flight back changed to Sarajevo-Pristina-Ljubljana. I accepted. The first flight via Munich was ok. Two hours before the return flight I got the email that the flight was cancelled. I had to rebook via hotline and had to accept a flight with Croatian to Zagreb. I reached Ljubljana 4 h later and had to organize Transport from Zagreb to Ljubljana on my own cost.

Adria Airways,1,"""worse than the budget airlines""",6th September 2019,False," Ljubljana to Zürich. Firstly, Ljubljana airport is terrible. Badly trained staff, unfriendly. Toilets are very dirty.

Adria Airways,1,"""book another company""",24th August 2019,False," First of all, I am not complaining about a specific flight. I am a Lufthansa frequent Flyer and I normally fly the route Munich - Timisoara. This summer season Lufthansa offered the flights on this route to Adria Airways, as they are a star alliance member. I can only tell that I have the worst experiences with them. In over 90% of the cases they are late, they don't fly on time. Always they offer the same excuse: they have no slot free. This is an unacceptable excuse, as all other companies flying on similar coridors seem not to have this problem. In addition, as LH Cityline was operating these flights I have almost never heard this excuse, or had this problem. I am flying on this route for 6 years already. They started also to cancel some flights. Maybe combine 2 flights into 1 to spare some money, who knows. The cabin crew is decent - not wow, not bad - but there also also situations when the staff are really rude and not customer oriented. I would recommend anyone to fly with this company.

Adria Airways,8,"""the crew was nice""",12th October 2018,True,"Ljubljana to Munich. The homebase airport of Adria Airways is Ljubljana and it very small, relaxing and convenient. It is surrounded by the Alps and the departure was fantastic. The airplane was modern and the crew was nice. Ontime departure. Drinks without alcohol were free and I paid 4€ for my white wine.

Adria Airways,1,"""Very bad experience overall""",5th October 2018,False, Zurich to Ljubljana. Very poor customer service. Flight was cancelled without sending any email confirmation.

Adria Airways,1,"""bad customer service""",29th July 2018,True," Vienna to Sofia. The flight was delayed by 2 hours. The cabin crew was annoyed that they had to offer drinks to the passengers and passing by announced they would only give one drink per customer. And coffee was a nuisance and they made it clear, even though it was on their cart. The questions would normally go ""would you drink anything?"" and not ""what would you like to drink?"".

Adria Airways,2,"""overall very poor""",19th July 2018,True," We were traveling from Paris to Skopje on May 4th, via Ljubljana. Our flight from Ljubljana to Skopje, was canceled 10 days before our departure for no reason, leaving us in the middle of our connection at Ljubljana. Even if the company booked a hotel for us and made sure we could take a flight the next day, it prevented us from enjoying one more day in Macedonia. The company had agreed to reimburse the hostel night we had already paid but more than two months after our claim we still have no reply from the company. I e-mailed the company two times, called them on multiple occasion. The company said I would be reimbursed after 2 months. 2 months later, I still have not received anything. The experience with Adria Airways was overall very poor : - flight canceled for no reason - 2 out of 4 of the flights we took were delayed - terrible customer service, unable to give any answer to our online claim and not reimbursing the hostel night we had already paid",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Skopje via Ljubljana,May 2018,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,no
Adria Airways,2,"""Would not fly again""",30th June 2018,True," Ljubljana to Munich. Adria's checkin system is obviously barely coping. It wasn't possible to obtain an electronic boarding pass (iphone wallet version) from Adria's site. The option was there but it failed without any further explanation. Further more I was not able to checkin to return flight online - neither through Adria nor Lufthansa web site. In the end I made it via Lufthansa mobile app. Go figure. Both issues were reported to customer care and both were ignored. I experienced the same customer care ""policy"" couple of years ago when my inquiry with customer support was basically ignored. Flight was actually operated by a Romanian company Carpatair. The cabin was outdated and dirty with a funny smell lingering around. The latter stuck to my clothes for the day - not that great if you are meeting a client. Cabin crew was also quite disorganised and mixed up orders of all passengers sitting around me. Would not fly again. Unfortunately they are the only company offering a direct flight from LJU to MUC.",,Business,Economy Class,Ljubljana to Munich,June 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,no
Adria Airways,3,"""very unpleasant experience""",24th June 2018,True," A very unpleasant experience for my family. We bought two return flights (Ljubljana-Prague-Ljubljana, Ljubljana-Warsaw-Ljubljana), and several days before departure both direct flights from and to Prague were canceled and a flight to Warsaw was merged with Prague flight (so added necessary stopover). Instead of a direct flight to Prague Adria Airways finally offered a transfer via Munich. When we arrived at the airport (21/6/2018), we found that the flight to Munich had more than an hour of delay, and therefore it was not possible to catch the next flight from Munich to Prague. The flight to Munich was full of people from the original canceled flight to Prague, who subsequently wanted to continue to Prague. Although the Adria Airways staff were present at the airport, no one came to inform the passengers and the result was tremendous confusion and lack of information. Ljubljana airport servicing staff finally informed us that Adria Airways staff refused to come! Also wasn't possible to call the Adria Airways hotline. Maybe it had been overloaded due to the number of disgruntled passengers because the next gate was full of people waiting for a delayed flight to Vienna, where there also wasn't anybody from Adria Airways who could provide any information. Unfortunately this flight left without us and we were all forced to ride from the Munich airport to a more than 30 km distant hotel and the next morning at 6am again back. Permanent cancellation of flights and subsequent ignorance of passengers are surely a way to reduce operating costs, but in the long-term this will cause the outflow of passengers to other airports around Slovenia, especially to Graz and to Zagreb.",A319,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ljubljana to Prague,June 2018,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,no

We were not given any food or water and when I requested some I was told to complain to Adria Airways website. Another plane was organized, more than 2 hrs later.

Adria Airways,3,"""should be ashamed of their operations""",5th December 2017,True," Ljubljana to Vienna. Overall, the flight services of Adria are those of an average, reliable, small European carrier. I have flown them many times over the years, and I have seldom experienced any problems with the flights themselves. Returning to Vienna from a visit to Albania and Slovenia in September, however, I had an encounter with Adria that has revealed just how much their customer service quality could be improved. Adria offers opportunities to purchase business class upgrades or empty economy class seats through Optiontown. Business class upgrades on Adria are a joke because you're paying at least 50EUR for an empty seat next to you and a snack. The option to purchase an empty economy class seat at 19EUR is a great deal though, in my opinion. Having selected this option for my LJU-VIE flight, I received a confirmation that my transaction had cleared and the extra seat had been assigned next to me. Fast forward to the actual flight: there had been an aircraft change from the CRJ-900 to an ATR-72 (Darwin Airlines/Etihad Regional), but I still had my empty seat. The ATR-72 has two seats that face towards the rear of the plane at the front of the cabin, and one of the women seated there was scared to fly backwards, so the flight attendant unilaterally reassigned her to my empty seat without asking. It's a short flight, and I didn't want to cause a scene, so I just let it all happen assuming I could easily get a refund for my 20EUR transaction. It took exactly one month for Adria's customer service team to respond to me, and they said that my ""business class upgrade"" had not cleared, so I was not charged. I had never requested a business class upgrade, and I was charged for the empty seat I had in fact requested, so I sent all of the relevant receipts and statements back to Adria. Three weeks later, I still have yet to receive a response, so I simply disputed the charge with my credit card company that was easily able to understand the issue and refunded the money. 3-4 weeks+ response time from customer service is absolutely embarrassing, and Adria should be ashamed of their operations. It's sad for an otherwise perfectly acceptable airline to lose a customer over 20EUR.",ATR-72,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ljubljana to Vienna,September 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,no
Adria Airways,9,"""Two nice short flights""",20th November 2017,True,"Two nice short flights from Ljubljana to Sarajevo and back. First flight with Adria, flight back with Adria Switzerland. Flight to Sarajevo delayed due to fog in Sarajevo, Adria quickly changed an aircraft so that it was possible to land in foggy weather (CRJ instead of ATR). Product depends weather it is Adria or Adria Switzerland. Adria with snack, water and buy on board product, Adria Switzerland with snack, water, tea and coffee and without buy on board. I personally prefer the second option.

Adria Airways,2,"""extremely bad service""",27th October 2017,False,We were 11 people coming in with a short connection to Zurich hoping to continue with Adria to Ljubjana. We were before final call at the departure gate. Other people were still boarding. Adria had decided to rebook us and could not put us back on the plane. I and my wife had no checked in baggage. We had to wait 5 hours for next flight. This was extremely bad service and will do our utmost to never have to fly Adria again.

But they lost our baggage, if we didn't persistently call the airport we wouldn't have our bags for a week because they are lazy. One bag was badly damaged and things missing. We did everything they told us to do to report it but they didn't honor it and it took 3 months for them to pay us around 20% of the replacements and extra expenses we had for days. Very rude, try to blame it on the customer, if you don't live in Slovenia and your only communication is over emails it takes 2 to 3 weeks for them to reply even if you send them email right after they sent one. That day they lost baggage for 3 different passengers and when we had our return flight there were two more passengers that said they lost their bags so this is normal for that airline. It was a cheaper option to fly with them, but it was not worth the extra cost later. I would never fly this airline again.

Adria Airways,9,"""can't remember a flight delay""",19th April 2017,False,"Ljubljana to Zurich on April 18th. Adria Airways has become in recent years a more reliable airline which I use for these flights. I can't remember a delay and I fly them once a month. Flight Attendants are professionel. Food and Drinks (except water) have to be purchased. Sandwiches are tasty, wine choice could be better. Newspapers are available for free but mostly in Slovenian language only. Seat pitch on emergency exits are above international standards and safety seems to be their Nr. 1 aim as it is one of the rare airlines having extra safety instructions for passengers seated on emergency exit seats. Their inflight magazine is available online or printed.

Adria Airways,8,"""seat was quite comfortable """,27th January 2017,False," Ljubljana to Vienna. After a fast boarding procedure the plane took off in time. The seat was quite comfortable although the cabin looked a bit nagged. Despite the fact that this was a regional flight, Adria Airways offered a Wifi service with good connection, an IFE system and free chat function amongst the passengers.

What a great surprise as you arrive to your seat. Loved it. Although the meal wasn't the best, it was good and the wine very good.

The flight with Adria was chosen due to convenience, however if I had an option to choose next time, the value for money is not there nor the experience. Outdated aircraft (buzzing from AC in the upper compartment present the whole time of descending and extremly anoying. Complimentary glass of water and snack (pretzles). Other options only upon payment (does not seem acceptable fot the price over 400 eur).

Adria Airways,2,"""fleet is tired and outdated""",21st October 2016,False," Munich to Ljubljana. Adria Airways as the national carrier pretty much holds a monopoly in this market and even those few carriers who had flown limited scheduled routes into the Slovenian capital, Air France and Swiss, have regretfully withdrawn their services. I have spent a lifetime of flying and the Adria product, I am sorry to say, is grossly inadequate. There is nothing appealing about Adria's offering and what incentive do they have to lift their standard when there is no competition to stimulate improvement? The entire fleet is tired and outdated. The business class product is non existent, staff are at best disinterested, leaning towards unfriendly. And what's with those announcements? They are completely impossible to understand, not just in English and German but also in Slovenian. If not having flown as often as I have to know what the announcements are about, there is no hope in hell that a normal person can understand the dribble that comes over the PA. Guess how many uninformed passengers does that make for? If one is not fluent in a language, and heavily accented, then one must slow down so others can hopefully understand you. But what's their excuse of not pronouncing Slovenian correctly. Everything is executed at such a speed so they can place a tick against that task, yet no care is invested to make sure the task is executed effectively. ! Pick up your game or your end will come one day when monopoly is broken (look around the world to learn from other such stories).  I have found a solution to avoid flying Adria Airways where possible - Turkish Airlines presence is now pretty strong in LJU and I can't fault their service. Whenever flying into LJU from a geographical destination where IST is a logical place to transit, TK is my carrier of choice.",CRJ-900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,MUC to LJU,October 2016,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no
Adria Airways,3,"""underwhelming and unimpressive""",10th October 2016,False," Ljubljana to Amsterdam. First experience with Adria Airways was underwhelming and unimpressive. Flight sat on tarmac fully boarded for 20 minutes without explanation; causing 20 minute delay on arrival without comment from crew and despite many passengers with tight connections in AMS. Crew was the least personal I've experienced in my 30+ flights in 2016. The crew quickly passed through the cabin holding a large bottle of water but without offering it; everything else is buy-on-board at unappealing prices. Aging CRJ-900 showed its wear, limited on-air entertainment, but able to select bulkhead seat at check-in so legroom was good. Compared to inbound flight on Air France, Adria lacked any sort of the polished, personal touch that its in-flight magazine claims it wants to project. To LJU, however, the options are few and the schedules erratic, so Adria will often be the only rational choice for many sectors.",CRJ-900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LJU to AMS,October 2016,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

No free snacks or even drinks, which is very sad for a Star Alliance partner, because their fare prices are high but offer is similar to low cost airlines. Beverages which they sell in their ""Air shop"" looks nice on advert, beautiful pictures, but when you buy it, you get small sandwich with bad taste.

Adria Airways,7,"""what happened in last few months""",3rd October 2015,False,"14 flights with Adria Airways this year. Flights usually on time, new aircraft, clean and bright cabins. Cabin crew members can be nice and professional or just fine. I do not know what happened in last few months; according to the last flight experience, this is not the right direction. On a flight to Moscow I experienced cabin crew getting from gloomy on a flight to SVO to even gloomier on a flight back to LJU. No smiles, just robotic and not interested in passengers and their comfort.  Well, at the end of the day, the real difference is the crew attitude.

Adria Airways,8,Adria Airways customer review,6th September 2014,False,Adria serves this 100 min flight from Ljubljana to Amsterdam on a brand new CRJ900 Next Gen which has a hugely improved cabin. Much more spacious higher ceiling and with big windows. The seats seem to be more comfortable and have more legroom. The business class is not separated from the main cabin though not even with the standard back seat curtain.

The stewardess said that I could not buy it and could not use a credit card or purchase it in cash without their preferred currency. When I pointed out that they were able to sell duty free with visa cards she huffed and puffed and basically said it would be ""difficult"". She never offered me a tiny cup of water.

Crew friendly on board nothing special regarding entertainment or service. But flight duration's were short too so nothing to complain about. What I loved the most was a fast transit process in Ljubljana since its small airport and immigration was very fast.

Adria Airways,5,Adria Airways customer review,1st June 2014,False,I had flights from Paris to Sarajevo via Ljubljana. Adria Airways provides a low cost product these days. The food and beverages become for purchase including water. This is acceptable for short flights but it should be clearly indicated during the ticket purchase on their web-site. There are no hot options and quality of sandwiches is really poor. Besides the service was very friendly and efficient. Both flights arrived on time.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,yes
Adria Airways,9,Adria Airways customer review,10th May 2014,False,LJU to FRA and back both flights were on time. Flights were made by CRJ900 NextGen aircraft. Very clean cabin and comfortable seats.

Adria Airways,8,Adria Airways customer review,13th January 2014,False,On my Ljubljana - Munich flight in business class Adria used the CRJ-900 Next Generation which is a great plane. I love the very large windows which are at a proper height so that you don't have to bend your neck down in order to look out the window like on the older versions of this Bombardier equipment. Moreover the aircraft is very quiet. It's a short flight but in business class you got a good meal and a comfy seat.,,,Business Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,yes

It was on a very clean Airbus A319 and it was a light load flight. The crew were warm and kind especially the Purser who took her time walked and talked to several passengers. They even offered me a pillow and blanket which I appreciated. A warm refreshment with selections of cold/hot beverage were offered on this 2 hours flight. We took off about 5 minutes earlier and landed more or less 20 minutes earlier. It was a relaxing flight and I do hope they will be flying to more destinations in the future since Slovenia is a beautiful and lovely country to visit.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,yes

Water bottle for each passenger even on short flights like these and coffee offered on second flight. Aircraft departed on time boarding was efficient captain kept passengers updated no IFE of course bags arrived very quickly. In LJU nicely stocked Priority Pass lounge and is a nice small airport MUC is an awesome airport to connect through.

Adria Airways,7,Adria Airways customer review,19th August 2013,False,If I have to fly a regional jet then I prefer the new generation CRJ 900 which Adria used on today's flight from Amsterdam to Ljubljana.

During flight some pleasant cold snacks tasty and attractively presented. Drinks on demand. Cabin crew all very friendly good eye contact and knowledge of English. Seats just normal economy ones. Transfers in Ljubljana a bit confusing. In one direction followed signs into a passage which was locked. A couple of minutes later somebody came and let us out to go through security. On the return leg did not have to go through security there. Disappointing that Ljubljana Duty Free shop does not sell alcohol after 9pm.

Seats were comfortable enough for a 1-2 hours flight. Boarding was easy for all flights. Ljubljana airport is very small and nice. The only downside is the absence of any snack.

Adria Airways,9,Adria Airways customer review,8th October 2012,False,BEG-LJU-BEG with CRJ200 great regional airline with excellent airport. Too bad the airport is not too busy.

Adria Airways,5,Adria Airways customer review,4th July 2012,False,I fly at least once a month ZRH-LJU-ZRH. My experience is that the staff on the ground need a better education regarding how to care of passengers. If it comes to a delay and pax have to go to the info desk to change tickets and so on then you really see of how unfriendly and unprepared staff are.

Adria Airways,5,Adria Airways customer review,17th June 2012,False,LTN to LJU outbound with CRJ200 return with CRJ900. Both legs on time. Just a tiny sandwich and only one round of drinks but ok for a 2 hr flight. Slow and unfriendly staff. Very little room in CRJ200 even though it was not full.

Adria Airways,9,Adria Airways customer review,16th February 2012,False,LJU-FRA and FRA-LJU. First flight on time return flight slightly delayed due to heavy snow in FRA.

Comfortable seats and generous leg- room with CRJ 900 to FRA and CRJ 200 to LJU. Both airplanes very clean and seemingly well maintained all in all quite an enjoyable experience.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,yes
Adria Airways,5,Adria Airways customer review,17th January 2012,False,LJU-FRA-LJU. Both flights on time. Flight attendants are friendly however they allowed 3 different versions of female uniforms on the same flight. A white T-shirts under an apron looks very casual for a flag-carrier. The planes are quite worn and promotional messages on the seats for an insurance company look cheap. Food is ok taking in consideration that it was just an 1 hour flight.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,no
Adria Airways,9,Adria Airways customer review,20th September 2011,False,Smart and efficient service. Small planes but as a tall man (6ft 4) I did not feel cramped either on the CRJ-200 (AMS-LJU) or the CRJ-900 (LJU-AMS). The cabin crew were friendly and the food for such a short flight was good. Also the price was right.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,yes
Adria Airways,9,Adria Airways customer review,13th September 2011,False,FRA-VIE in Business Class. A great little airline transferred to them after our transatlantic flight. The advantage for the CRJ sitting on a remote stand was that we got a really interesting ride around Frankfurt airport with operating aircraft taxiing landing taking off all around us. Onboard the crew were pleasant and managed to serve a hot lunch to us during the 60 mins flight. We departed and arrived on time and the flight was smooth.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,yes
Adria Airways,1,Adria Airways customer review,13th September 2011,False,London Gatwick to Ljubljana and Ljubljana to Vienna in Business Class. Delayed slightly at Gatwick but that happens.

Short flights and light meals/snacks served.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,yes
Adria Airways,7,Adria Airways customer review,19th January 2011,False,ZRH to LJU as a continuation to a flight with Swiss. Adria were not as good as Swiss but they did make us feel welcome onboard and look after us. The return flight was much better than the outbound flight with the cabin crew smiling and talking to passengers. The CRJ was clean and looked in better condition than other airlines equipment I have flown in the past.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,yes
Adria Airways,5,Adria Airways customer review,7th January 2011,False,I fly Adria a lot (at least once a month) and find them ok. The service is mixed. Often the supervisor is not ready for boarding and there is no-one to greet. Last time when I boarded the crew were having their photo taken on the tarmac so we all had to stand and wait until they finished. Food is fine and the hand luggage service where it is delivered on the tarmac on landing works well on the CRJ aircraft.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,no
Adria Airways,5,Adria Airways customer review,10th October 2010,False,I fly Adria quite a lot (aprox 2 flts a month). My routes are normally VIE-LJU or ZRH-LJU. I always wondered why Adria is not high profile airline being small can be a plus. The CRJ200 and 1000 are OK specially 1000 which are brand new and also A319 latest delivery. I hate that they never board on time neither depart on time. For 20 pax you should be in the air in about 15 min. But they lose a lot of time after the boarding is completed and the take off. The service is worse every time. Now you get a small pack of seeds or dry fruit and a bottle of water. The flights are normally only 30 mins but nevertheless I miss the nice box with good sandwich water and a small dessert. The price is well overpriced for what they offer. There were old inflight magazines in cabin. Crew is good but sometimes too familiar with passengers or fellow colleagues.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,no
Adria Airways,6,Adria Airways customer review,25th November 2009,False,"This was my first time with Adria. Short hop from KBP to LJU. The airline is 3 star but my ticket had 5 star price tag. Online sale worked fine online check-in system issued me a pass with wrong boarding time (nearly 2 hours early). Luckily their call center worked well and I was told to report to the airport at normal time and use ""wrong"" boarding pass. It really worked. There were about 14 passengers onboard Canadair200. The plane was new and clean. Seats were very narrow however seat pitch was okay. My seat didn't work well so I did take off and landed in reclined position. Food was much below average (small cheese sandwich) bar service was good and generous. Flight departed late but made it in the air and landed about ontime. Crew were cheerful and attentive. My special meal was delivered and was okay (much better then standard sandwiches offered to other passengers). All in all a real strong 3 star experience but overpriced ticket. Also saw no difference between business and economy cabin. Same seats for different price.",,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,yes
Adria Airways,7,Adria Airways customer review,27th May 2009,False,ZRH-LJU-ZRH with CRJ-900. New plane with pleasant cabin interior and comfortable leather seats. Flights on time food ok. Adria Airways has new uniforms (60 style) and the flight attendants are attentive. Web-Check-in works excellent.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,yes
Adria Airways,5,Adria Airways customer review,26th May 2009,False,It is reliable and with good connections between Balkans and Western Europe. However I always find the service on the leg between Skopje and Ljubljana to be lower quality than the leg Ljubljana- Amsterdam Ljubljana - Frankfurt etc. The crew is not so friendly and helpful they always offer tuna sandwiches (assuming that because of the Muslim travelers). I insisted on a ham sandwich and never got it. Twice on the leg Ljubljana-Skopje (or vice versa). If Adria pretends to be a quality part of Star Alliance it shouldn't distinguish among the passengers which fly Skopje - Ljubljana and those flying from Ljubljana to Western Europe.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1.0,yes
Adria Airways,3,Adria Airways customer review,28th February 2009,False,LGW-LJU in Y class. Adria Airways now offer check in on line so it was straight to security which was great. Boarding quick and efficient. Plane downgraded from CRJ9 to CRJ2 but emergency exit seat reservation honoured. Waited on the stand for 30 minutes with no communication from the flight deck. Service was nice with sandwiches hot and cold drinks. Cabin crew were quite robotic seems that pursers are trained not to smile under any circumstances. If crew would have been bit more cheerful and communication from the flight deck bit better it would have been 4*.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,4,Adria Airways customer review,29th May 2008,False,London to Tirana via Ljubljana Economy Class. 30 minutes late on first leg due to air traffic restrictions at Gatwick but Adria held the connecting flight for us even though there were only a handful of people transferring from the London flight. The food was adequate on both legs and the crew were friendly. All in all a perfectly acceptable journey and I would fly Adria again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,4,Adria Airways customer review,12th May 2008,False,Ljublijana-Amsterdam. A great little airline. Although the CRJ-200 is a little cramped the service was good with a proper meal adequate refreshments and competent cabin crew. Their inflight magazine is in English and Slovenian and has an interesting mix of articles and company information. Same can't be said about Brnk international airport however! This airport needs a 'spruce up' to say the least.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,4,Adria Airways customer review,11th February 2008,False,FRA-VIE-FRA on CRJ200. Cheapest option when compared to Lufthansa and Austrian plying this short 1.5 hour flight. Small plane meant a long bus ride to remote stand position. Larger carry-on bags had to be deposited in a trolley parked next to the plane. Aircraft spotless but leather seats showing their age - quite saggy in the squab. Service consisted of a choice of crusty cheese or ham roll followed by drinks tea & coffee. FAs smiling. The return was similarly uneventful but again a long bus ride at FRA. Luggage claim was quick.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,4th October 2007,False,BRU-LJU-BRU. Outward flight on a CRJ200 very nice - comfortable excellent service and a good breakfast. Return flight on a 737 leased from Ukrainian airlines was also reasonable despite the limited legroom. Earning Star Alliance points also a plus - would recommend.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,8th August 2007,False,I often fly with Adria (50 flights per year). Since Adria is member of Star Alliance there are pretty good connections to the most destinations in Europe. The onboard service is good staff quiet nice. Home base airport in Ljubljana has been upgraded and is getting more international. The business lounge is not on the level it should be - old furniture bad food choice dark. The 3 stars that have been given to Adria are correct.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,14th July 2007,False,LGW-LJU-LGW on an older but clean A320. Outwards in 7A with plenty of legroom return in 12F with adequate legroom but need to be careful as the plastic shell on the bottom of the seat in front had started to crack with some sharp edges. Cheese roll served outbound and a jam filled croissant on the return - better than nothing but room for improvement. Coffee and soft drinks free but only one round early in the flight. Very pleasant crew on both sectors. Only gripe was baggage collection at LJU - three flights on one carousel and they seemed to unload baggage in batches from each flight turn about which caused chaos. The second carousel sat unused for the first 40 minutes waiting!,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,24th March 2007,False,Frankfurt-Ljubljana-Munich in business class: the first flight was on a B737 in the colours of Ukraine International and that plane's interior was substandard while the second flight was on a new CRJ. Both flights on time and without glitch. The service is friendly but meals should be improved. Overall they gave the impression of being a pleasant short haul airline.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,9th October 2006,False,Zurich-Ljubljana return. About 2 hours+ journey. Both sector uses the Bombardier Regional Jet CRJ200. Small plane but the 2-3 crews on both sectors were friendly and the service efficient. Seats were comfortable and the planes in good clean conditions. Light meals were served - generally a roll here or a pie there plus drinks. The inflight magazine is surprisingly rich with information on Slovenian culture and way of life and is one of the best I have read. You board the planes on the tarmac via buses from the gates though and not through connecting bridges.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,29th September 2006,False,LGW-LJU return. Outbound was on A320 seated towards the front of Y-class on a very empty flight. The crew were friendly enough and served a ham or cheese roll and round of drinks. LJU airport was easy to use and out within minutes. The coach ride into town goes through some nice Slovenian countryside. Return was on a B737-500 flight was full and had a middle seat but exit row (9E) seat pitch was great. Again right after take off was served with a cream pie desert and drinks. Crew were again friendly and another smooth flight that landed about 15mins ahead of schedule.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,27th September 2006,False,LGW-LJU-LGW last week overall impressed with standard of service on A320. The food in economy was very basic but I didn't expect any! Drinks free. Was allocated row 11 (emergency exit) with out asking she said your very tall(6'4) I will give you some more leg room! Only minor complaint was the seat base comfort it was rock hard like sitting on a wood bench. On the return the seat in row 25 was little better they seem to have cut back on the foam. Crew were excellent a nice airline all in all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,2nd August 2006,False,DUB-NAP. Was expecting very poor standards of both safety and comfort from this airline but was surprised. Flight at 5.00 am and the FA's were refreshed and alert. Pre flight safety procedures were clear and as high a standard as any other 3 star airline. The seats were quite hard and leg room was limited but the flight was made pleasant by friendly FA's. In flight catering was poor considering it was a four hour flight. We were handed almost frozen sandwiches and a juice box. Baggage collection was mayhem. All in all the flight was fair and would fly Adria again - but the airline does not compare to other 3 star airlines such as Aer Lingus and KLM.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,21st February 2006,False,Frankfurt to Vienna and was quite satisfied. I was surprised when the flight attendant started giving out meals as I did not expect to be fed at all on such a short flight of only 55 minutes. It was perhaps a bit cramped on board the Canadair Regional Jet though I wouldn't complain about it. Crew was overall quite friendly and efficient.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,1st October 2005,False,Flew to Ljubljana from Gatwick. Plane was a new Canadair Regional Jet small (40 seats) but good leg room and comfortable. Both cabin crew were friendly. Food was just a cheese or ham roll but fine for a 1 hr 40 minute flight. And Adria were one of the only airlines leaving Gatwick that evening not to be delayed. Return flight was an A320 full comfortable and good service once again. Would recommend Adria again and worth paying the extra 20quid over Easyjet for flying from Gatwick and not having to pay for food or drink.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,15th September 2005,False,Round trip LGW - LJU in Economy Class both legs on an A320. Service pretty friendly planes clean & well-maintained flights on time. Food on each leg (outbound mid-morning return early morning) was a simple processed cheese roll though for a two-hour flight the food is probably not the most important aspect of the journey. All-in-all a pretty reasonable experience with no major complaints.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,3rd December 2004,False,I have used their VIE-FRA-VIE service several times. All flights were on time the atmosphere on board (CRJ) fine service is friendly although their snack and drinks are not outstanding. But for a flight of 1 hour what should it be? Codesharing with LH enables to collect miles though they dont count for status.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,18th March 2004,False,Flew march 12/14 on JP from ZRH-LJU-ZRH. The flights were on time the flight attendants nice and helpful. The sandwich has got an upgrade and is now equal to LH. A Minus point was that they were handing out only Apple Juices - if you wanted to have wine or other drinks you had to ask specifically for it. This gives me kind of a cheap impression as it seems to the passenger that they wanted to hide it from them. The wine they served was below industry standards and not what a wine country like Slovenia should serve its guests on their trip to the country. I absolutely agree that on such short legs there is no necessity of any food/drinks however either this is clearly defined in the service guide of the airline or then crews should adhere to their service guidelines.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,1st November 2003,False,Round trip LGW - LJU in Business Class. Check-in staff at LGW very efficient and friendly. A320 clean and staff most helpful. Food and Wine need improvement. Flights all on time and overall a pleasant experience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,31st July 2003,False,In July 2003 I flew London (Gatwick)-Ljubljana-Skopje return in Business Class. Overall I was quite impressed. All flights departed and arrived on time and the onboard service was efficient and reasonably friendly. Hot meals were served on all flights although the quality of these varied from disgusting to just OK. All drinks were complimentary. The aircraft (A320 and CRJ) were modern and spotlessly clean. Business Class seating is identical to economy with a moveable curtain. Transiting at Ljubljana was painless although it is a very small airport and the Business Class lounge is nothing special. I would happily fly with them again although they do need to improve the quality of their meals.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,6th December 2002,False,I have just returned from a long weekend in Ljubljana flying on Adria from London Gatwick. The outbound flight was ok (food portions were a bit stingy given the 2 hour 20 minute flight time) and we arrived early into Ljubljana. Beware about arriving on a Saturday - the coach to the city centre are few and far between. I ended up taking a taxi which cost me 6500 SIT (about UKP 20) whereas the bus was 600 SIT (1.40). On the return flight Adria cancelled the flight for 'technical reasons'. Judging by the low number of people that went to the passenger service counter I think the reason for cancellation may have been more economic than technical. I was rerouted via Munich which added over an hour and a half to the journey and we flew into Heathrow (with BA) instead of Gatwick which left me with a useless train ticket and no way of getting home. The flight to Munich with Adria was good and an edible snack was served with apple juice. Despite the problems with the return journey Adria seems to be a reasonable airline and is an ok (if not the only) choice to get to this country.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,25th August 2002,False,I have flown Adria recently on a LH code share from Munich to Ljubjana and return. In both cases the plane was a brand new CRJ. Both flights were really smooth and the crews really efficient and helpful. Pilots kept us informed about everything during both flights. It was sunset and dusk and the flight over the alps was absolutely scenic. Despite the narrow cabin of the CRJ the pitch is quite generous and the leather seats comfortable. Both flights lasted 45 minutes and from MUC to LJU I travelled tourist class. Normally in short flights there isnt time for much than a drink. We receive an apple juice a cheese and salad sandwich plus coffee and tea. The LJU-MUC and due to an overbooking was on business. We were offered an orange juice prior to departure and then a tasty breakfast consisting in bacon and scramble eggs fruit salad a croissant and coffe and tea. Superb for such a short segment. Not being a prime choice its an airline which is pleasant to flight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Aegean Airlines,3,"""upgrade to business hardly ever comes""",17th November 2024,True,"  I’m a frequent traveller for the last 20 years. I’ve flown Aegean Airlines more than 50 times. They offered a very good service but during the last 3-4 years, they’re growing fast and customer service is not their priority anymore. My views based on the last 4 flights with Aegean during the summer seasons they were delayed (more than 60 min), with my checked luggage lost twice. To be avoided during Summer! Their boarding is the slowest and most unorganised allowing passengers with several bags per person, not entering all in the plane, blocking the corridor and sending half the bags out to be picked up at the airport’s belt. Forr Gold/frequent travellers of Aegean, we are entitled to 4 vouchers/year for business upgrades.

Aegean Airlines,5,“claims to be pet-friendly”,27th October 2024,True,"While my journey with Aegean Airlines started pleasantly, the arrival experience at Athens Eleftherios Venizelos was highly disappointing, especially regarding handling my pets. The check-in crew at London Heathrow was friendly and helpful, but this positive experience was overshadowed by what happened upon arrival in Athens. Aegean Airlines promotes itself as pet-friendly, but my experience showed otherwise. Traveling alone with three small dogs in separate kennels, I expected clear guidance or assistance from the airline, especially since they knew I was a single passenger. Unfortunately, no instructions were given, and no representatives offered help. After a delayed luggage pickup, I was left to search for where my dogs might be. After asking an airport cleaner for help (because no one else was around, like airport representatives), I eventually located my dogs’ crates abandoned on the floor in a different section of the baggage area—an upsetting and unacceptable situation. To make matters worse, an airport staff member nearby was on her phone and didn’t care to assist or greet me. There was also no help handling the kennels on a trolley, making it incredibly difficult for pets to navigate and find transport out of the airport. For an airline that claims to be pet-friendly, this experience was far from it—terrible customer service from Aegean Airlines on the ground in Athens.

Still one of the very few full service carriers with a classic service offering a welcome dring before departure and a full (hot) meal with option to choose from for the main menu. It's the small details that count with Aegean such as the cloth serviette (haven't seen this for quite some time on any medium haul with any airline) or the possibility to order a tasty Cappucino or Espresso. Additionally, typically new aircraft are used between FRA/MUC and Athens (A 320 neo/ A 321 neo) which adds to the overall excellent experience. Unfortunately, I had a short layover in Athens on my way to Paros and as the flight from Frankfurt was slightly delayed, I couldn't catch my flight to Paros. Outstanding incident handling by Aegean Airlines - they rebooked me on the first available flight next morning and sent me an SMS with a reservation confirmation at Athens Sofitel Airport hotel where complementary dinner and breakfast was offered.

We only found out once we were already on the plane, after we asked a flight attendant, who casually informed us. She reassured us that the customer help desk in Athens would take care of everything. They did nothing. In Athens, we were told it wasn't their problem, and we were left to fend for ourselves with no solution, no assistance, and no care.

Aegean Airlines,6,"""give up on short connections""",14th September 2024,True,"  Aegean was a very good company in recent years. It is still so during the low season (winter) where flights are on time and in the event of problems (especially weather) the support is efficient. On the other hand, their new planes are much less comfortable than the old ones with greatly reduced legroom. This negatively changes the flying experience compared to previous years. Furthermore, traveling with them in summer has become a real hell,flights are very often late (especially evening ones) with compromised connections. And no assistance, you have to figure out how to find a hotel not to mention that postponements are often automatic (without any choice possible because the suitcases are automatically sent on the flight chosen by the company) so arrival at 11:30 p.m. next flight canceled and scheduled for 4:35 a.m. No possibility of collecting the suitcases and therefore taking a later flight to rest. This is the last time I travel with them in summer.  They should give up on short connections which never work... a very good company in winter on the other hand. Aegean était une très bonne compagnie ces dernières années. Elle l'est encore lors de la basse saison (hiver) où les vols sont à l'heure et en cas de problèmes (notamment meteo) la prise en charge est efficace. Par contre leurs nouveaux avions sont bien moins confortables que les anciens avec des espaces pour les jambes fortement réduits. Cela change négativement l'expérience de vol par rapport aux années précédentes. Par ailleurs voyager avec eux en été est devenu un véritable enfer... les vols sont très souvent en retard (surtout ceux du soir) avec des correspondances compromises. Et aucune assistance c'est débrouillez vous pour trouver un hôtel ... sans comptez que les reports sont souvent automatiques (sans choix possible parce que les valises sont automatiquement envoyés sur le vol choisi par la compagnie...) ainsi arrivée à 23h30 vol suivant annulé et prévu à 4.35. Pas possible de récupérer les valises et donc de prendre un vol plus tard pour se reposer... nuit blanche à l'aéroport.

The staff were very polite and helpful. From the people at the Aegean's lounge in Athens, to the people in the gates and the flight crew, they were happy to help with a smile on their faces. When I got to Athens airport and passed the security check I realized that I had booked economy light class, which, as the websites states, you can only carry either a hand luggage OR a personal item, but I was carrying both. I tried searching for an Aegean help desk at the terminal I was in but I couldn't find one, so I asked the staff at the lounge for directions. They told me the help desk is accessible only before the security check and asked me what the problem was to figure out if they could help. They could have just said it's not our job to help you since we are at a lounge, but they did either way. I explained the issue with the luggage and they told me I could call the Aegean's call center since they weren't informed. Even though it was 4am they picked up immediately and informed me that the rules about economy light have changed since May 2024 and that I could carry both a hand luggage and a personal item, they just didn't update the rules in their website yet. During flight they give economy class a sandwich (there's also a vegan option), cookies and a drink. There is also a website which can be visited during flight to see the location of the plane. The WiFi, unfortunately, didn't work for the majority of the duration of the flight. The only negative about this airline is the booking website. It's a bit laggy, slow, confusing and as it turns out, not regularly updated, in contrast to the mobile application which is very fast, informing and easy to use.

So we took the second option as we were going there for a festival and we did not want to miss any of the events as they were starting on the 16th of May and also to take a bus from the airport of Barcelona to Costa Brava instead of a taxi that would cost a fortune. Then, due to about two hours of delay at the flight from ATH-SKG we asked if we are going to miss our transit flight from SKG to BCN, and if so to let us not travel to Thessaloniki and take the later flight from Athens. They told us that they will wait for us as it is a transit flight. We arrived there 5 minutes after the flight was scheduled, and of course they didn't wait for us, and they changed our tickets for the next day via Munich. We demanded that they change them back to go via Athens and then again Barcelona, which after 2-3 hours of waiting time and many food costs at the airport, they did. So we arrived at Barcelona at 01:00 after midnight and our only means of transport was a taxi, which costed us 170€, and of course we missed 1 day out of 4 of the festival. Of course Aegean doesn't want to refund any of these costs. M On our way back they lost our baggage. 24 hours later we received one back, but the second we are still waiting (3 days later).

I offer to pay for the extra weigh but they said it needed to go with checked luggage and they charged 50 euro. I checked later Aegean's site extra luggage calculator and the price to pay at the airport for an extra suitcase up to 23 kilos is shown to be 42 euro. They charged 50 euro for a less than 10 kilo suitcase. They did not give us time to lighten the luggage and avoid the extra cost as they were boarding and the flight was already in delay. The gate personel was hassling passengers and was rude to say the least. The lady working behind the gate counter was banging her hand on the desk and shouting to the couple next to me (also complaining about the surcharge) to learn to read the company policies in a condescending manner. I used to prefer Aegean over other air carriers although they offer very little legroom and a poor meal choice as I considered them reliable.

We were never issued boarding passes but we kept following up with the person at the ticket counter until they gave us passes, it seems like due to our persistence and nothing systematic. Luckily we got on that flight, but others didn’t. Nowhere in the policy does it say that whether or not you get on the flight is related to your check-in time. If you take Aegean, check in right away and be persistent about asking for seats! 2. They apply a checked bag policy at will. We were sitting near the gate. The gate attendants approached us and asked to weigh our bags. Our bags, which fit easily into any overhead bin (including previous Aegean flights) were found to be slightly overweight (apparently 9kgs are allowed, ours were about 10kgs). We asked if we could move 1kg into our purse / backpack. They said no, they need to check the two bags, and by the way they are charging us 40Euro per bag. This was for a 45 min flight from an island to Athens. We had no choice and were forced to pay. Also, there was no consistency in the way this rule was applied. We saw plenty of other people with carry-ons larger than ours allowed on the plane and there was plenty of space in the overhead bins. 3. Every flight we were on was late. Two of three were late by over 45 mins. We didn’t have any connections, but I imagine many connecting flights were missed. And, this didn’t happen to us, but it’s worth noting that when we landed in Athens, there were about 30 people waiting at the lost baggage desk. Most of them looked very angry. I asked one person what happened, and apparently an entire flight did not have their bags transferred at a connection. So not only will they force you to check your carry-on and then pay for a checked bag, they might lose it too. All-in-all, this is a pretty bad track record for 3 short island hop flights.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Athens to Chania,July 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,no

These were two short flights consisting of Sophia, Bulgaria to Athens and Athens to Larnaca, Cyprus. Both flights were exceptional. The flights were smooth and the seats were comfortable. The cabin service was outstanding. We received a snack (more of a light meal) on each flight, and both were delicious. The first flight included a small sandwich roll with sliced chicken and cheese; the second flight included a pasta salad with tuna and dressing. We enjoyed every bite! As we were leaving the plane in Larnaca I commented to the cabin staff at the exit of the plane that Aegean Airlines was now my new favorite airline. And it is. I opted to give the airline a rating of 9 instead of 10 due to two items: both flights were short. Had the flights been longer (more of a test of the airline service), I would have given the maximum rating. Also, Aegean's website is not as intuitive as most others I've used.

Once seated in 15C and having put my backpack above, I see the flight attendant pushing it to make space for someone's big suitcase.

The second problem was when I was about to board in Athens, when it was my turn they stopped me and asked for a Moroccan visa or residence permit, I said my passport didn't need a visa to Morocco for up to 3 months and I even gave him a look at the Moroccan visa policy and he really didn't care.

The ground crew were poor at making sure there was clarity in their announcements. I went up to a staff member when most people who appeared to be Corfu residents had just gone home, and asked was there any hotel booking arrangements - ""No"", any hotel used in such circumstances, don't know, any cost max, don't know, what about meals, don't know. Reclaiming? - ""you have to go to Aegean office in Athens"". I spoke to a British Corfu resident who said most expensive hotel open was Corfu Palace. I chose to go somewhere with a little better location and not so expensive. I then found out from the lady that just after I left, she was told that anyone needing a hotel could go to the Corfu Palace and all meals etc were covered and no need to pay. So, overall great experience - really well done ground crew: vital information not provided on a timely basi. The later flight was full as the following day was a general strike in Greece - so 2 nights had to stay in Corfu. On return flight cabin crew tolfd me there was no issue with the weather, the aircraft had a fault that could not be fixed in Corfu. Aegean states 10 days to get back to passenger with complaint, it is now 19 days.  It is now 19 days and not a word from Aegean. This was my 3rd flight with Aegean.

I hung up and tried to do as instructed . Only Problem is you can't buy a single ticket for anyone under the age of 18 - so I had to create a birthdate that made my daughter an adult to buy a ticket which created a whole new reservation (23X4UJ) Then I called back for a third time to combine the tickets and to fix my daughters birthdate. This customer service agent said that it was impossible to combine the tickets and that she couldn't fix the age and it would have to be done at the airport at check-in. I asked if she could just cancel both tickets and then I could repurchase correctly. She said no because my tickets werent refundable and I could apply for a voucher. Even though I just brought both tickets under the advice of two customer agents and simply wanted to rebook to combine the tickets so both passengers would be under one reservation - and would save me Time trying to explain to gate agents what happened.

I was very disappointed they could have at least done another drinks service - it made Virgin look amazing.

Aer Lingus,1,"""we were denied boarding""",14th September 2024,False," We recently had a very frustrating experience with Aer Lingus on flight EI429 from Pisa to Dublin on 18 August 2024. Despite arriving at the gate only three minutes late, we were denied boarding, even though the plane was still on the tarmac, near us, with the stairs down and the door open. The ground staff refused to let us board without even checking with the crew, which was completely unreasonable. To make matters worse, the staff showed no willingness to assist or explain the situation. They ignored our requests for clarification, even though we later discovered that the flight left with a delay of over an hour. This made their decision even more unacceptable. We have contacted Aer Lingus multiple times via email to seek clarification and assistance, but have received no response. The lack of customer service and basic communication is shocking. Due to this situation, we had no choice but to take four different modes of transportation (taxis and trains, all at additional cost) to reach Milan, where we finally managed to depart in the late evening, having to purchase new tickets once again with Aer Lingus I strongly urge Aer Lingus to reconsider how they handle customer situations and offer timely responses.

Aer Lingus,8,"""Economy Flex offered lounge access""",12th September 2024,True,"  Our second leg on this plane. The first was from Manchester to Belfast. There is no business class available for this flight but Economy Flex offered lounge access. We were allocated row 1 A&C which sounds great until you realise that the only passenger door, aside from emergency exits is at the rear of the plane. Consequently, we were almost the first onboard but the last off. Not such a big deal as the aircraft has only 72 seats. There is a trolley service on this one hour flight but we didn't bother, there seemed little point in paying for overpriced snacks and drinks. No IFE or Wi-fi on these flights.

Aer Lingus,1,"""never fly with Aer Lingus again""",4th September 2024,True,"  This airline is still living in the 20th century. Their app doesn’t display changed bookings, the app displays incorrect boarding & gate closure times, and the app doesn’t display your gate at all. That’s just the tip of the iceberg. Our first flight out of Chicago was delayed by an hour. They first said it was due to sanitizing the plane, but the pilot later admitted the aircraft had brake issues. Fine. We got to our layover late due to this (again, fine - these things happen). But there were no Aer Lingus personnel to be found anywhere near our gate that just closed to our connecting flight around 8am local time. We walked down past several gates and found an Aer Lingus gate agent that was just standing there. She asked us to wait so she could walk us to claim our baggage and take us through security again. 25 minutes passed before she called us to follow her. This was a red flag - a normal airline would have had us booked on the next flight immediately. Anyway, she walked us through some doors and asked us to wait there for her. She never came back! After 1/2 hour, we took it upon ourselves to find our luggage and go through customs to do so. Only one of our checked bags was found, and they had transferred it to our new flight that was already booked. Remember, this agent had us waiting around and walking all around the airport for no reason. We finally got on our next flight and landed in Rome another hour later than the rebooked flight was supposed to land! What a terrible experience. And not only that, but our three hour flight from Dublin to Rome didn’t even include a complimentary snack or water! Everything was at a cost. My God, What terrible service. We then spent hours at the luggage help desk and on the phone with Aer Lingus in an attempt to get our lost luggage. Their call center was clearly overseas and they were pretty useless. Luckily we had an AirTag in our luggage so we knew it made it to Rome. We sent proof of this to Aer Lingus per their request and they said they’d find it and send it to our resort. We called daily for updates, and each agent knew less than the previous. Luggage never arrived. We bought all new clothing. At the end of our trip, we asked a Rome airport agent (not Aer Lingus, just an airport agent) if we could check the lost baggage area. She let one of us in and we found it immediately. Needless to say, we’ll never fly with Aer Lingus again. Horrible, horrible airline.",A330,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Rome to Dublin,August 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Aer Lingus,1,"""my worst travel experience""",27th August 2024,True,"  On August 24, 2024, my Daughter and I attempted to travel from Amsterdam to Seattle via Dublin. The flight, EI605, was scheduled to depart Amsterdam at 1:15 pm. We arrived at the Aer Lingus counter to check in at 10:30 am. There were already 25-30 people in front of us waiting in line and no gate agent insight. By 11:30 am, there were at least 200 people waiting in line to check in. When I called the Aer Lingus number for the Netherlands and asked where the gate agents were I was told, “They usually show up 45 minutes before the flight departs”. At 11:32 a single gate agent showed up and started checking people in. 20 minutes later, a British Airways gate agent who had finished checking people for a British Airways flight next to us, walked over to an empty counter and started helping. By the time a third gate agent arrived it was 45 minutes before the scheduled departure time and there were still dozens of people waiting in line. Everyone was extremely anxious at this point because there was til the airport security line to get through. We arrived at the departure gate at 1:30 pm. Once onboard someone announced that the airline had decided to delay the departure so that all passengers could make the flight. Due to the delay, we missed our connecting flight to Seattle in DUblin. We arrived at gate #418 in Dublin, a gate agent was still present. She told us since we missed the flight we would have to go back to baggage claim, pick up our bags and proceed to a ticket counter to book another flight. She neglected to tell us we had to be escorted by an Aer Lingus employee to baggage claim. After about 30 minutes of looking for some help we finally met a very helpful woman named Loraine. She was kind enough to escort us and others in the same predicament to baggage claim. After retrieving our bags we went to the Aer Lingus “Ticket Assistance” counter. There a gentleman named Sean described our travel options, booked a flight for the following day and told us Aer Lingus would pay for a night in a local hotel as well as dinner. When we arrived at the Carlton Dublin Airport hotel, the people working the front desk told us the hotel was completely booked. When I asked if there were other hotels nearby I was told, “We’re a 4 star hotel, we only deal with other 4 star hotels and they’re all booked full as well”. We caught a ride back to the airport. When we arrived back at the Ticket Assistance counter and told our friend Sean what had happened he disappeared into a back office for a few minutes. When he returned he said, “Since all of our contracted hotels are booked, your only option is to obtain your own lodging and send us the receipt for reimbursement”. I called at least a dozen local hotels without success. By this time it was 6:30 pm and our flight to Seattle was scheduled to leave in 12 hours. We decided to spend the night in the terminal. To add insult to injury, when we arrived in Seattle my Daughter’s suitcase somehow failed to make the flight. We’re still waiting for it. I have been a professional pilot since 1987.

Aer Lingus,3,"""two of our bags failed to arrive""",3rd August 2024,True,"  Aer Lingus is not a 4 star airline. We chose this airline because we assumed by its rating here we would receive a good standard of service. It is important to us, as we were travelling with a physically challenged passenger. The actual onboard product was ok. They used older planes, but clean and functional. They had fairly good food and ok in-flight entertainment — would give it a better rating if the sound was improved. Their strength was their cabin crew. They were very good. Friendly & attentive. Where is all unravels for these guys, however, is their customer support & communication. Like mentioned, we traveled with a passenger that requires special assistance. I had communicated all the special needs months ahead of schedule, yet upon arrival at airport I learnt not all the information had been passed on. This is not totally abnormal unfortunately, but in this case, I couldn’t even call regarding the matter. I was reliant on an extremely slow & disorganised email service. In fact, we have already returned from our 3 week trip and some of the emails still haven’t been answered! Thankfully the cabin crew were able to help us when onboard, yet even they were frustrated with the lack of communication. On this trip two of our bags failed to arrive in Toronto and a bag was missing on return. It took 7 days to be reunited with one of our bags in Toronto, and when we got it, it was wet inside. In that process, the airline blamed Canadian customs. Canadian customs explained it was a typical ruse for an airline to blame them when they made a mistake. On this return leg, we have been waiting 4 days. There no real way to contact them to find out what the updates are. All we know is that it was loaded into a container in Dublin. As there are at least 2 Aer Lingus flights to Amsterdam per day, I can’t imagine what they are not doing.

Aer Lingus,1,"""six days getting reunited with our luggage""",24th July 2024,True," Day 1 - 10 AM : upon landing in Lyon (France) after flying from Toronto (Canada) through Dublin (Ireland), we find out our checked luggage are missing. Report and destination address submitted immediately through the kiosk, and confirmed with relevant luggage agent onsite. Are assured our luggage would get sent directly to airport closest to our destination (Turin, Italy) and delivered to our door, with a likely turnaround of 24 to 48 hours. Day 3 - 6 PM : our luggage lands in Turin (Italy), after flying through Lyon (France) and Frankfurt (Germany). That route contradicts what the onsite luggage agent had told us and added one extra unnecessary day to the initial delay. Day 5 - 5 PM : Turin Airport Lost and Found office advises our luggage is now in their possession (at this stage, it had already been in Turin Airport for nearly 48 hours), and notifies that we would have to fill in a customs form to allow them to proceed with our luggage shipping to our final destination, with an estimated delivery time of an additional 24 to 48 hours. At this stage, it could mean a full week for Aer Lingus to gets us reunited us with our luggage after they have located them (in Dublin airport) and were provided with our destination address. What took them an additional two days, adding to the previous unnecessary delay. Day 6 - 2 PM : we retrieved our luggage from Turin Airport Lost and Found office, despite the 3.5 hour drive involved. When asked how long they have been in Turin Airport, Sagat Handling claim “they don’t know, and are too busy to find out”. To summarise, my partner and I waited six days before getting reunited with our luggage, while anyone could fly from Dublin to Turin and back in a single day. After the sequence of mishaps and miscommunications that led to this outcome, you would expect some acknowledgement from the airline. I unfortunately had further opportunities to test Aer Lingus poor customer service tools and processes (offering no visibility on case history, status and next steps) and interest (simply receiving standard replies and templates - not addressing our case specifics), and escalated the saga to the highest executive level at Aer Lingus. Despite multiple attempts, none of them showed more professionalism or interest in customer experience satisfaction.

Seats are comfortable, aircraft are clean, food is good, flights have been on time and staff have been friendly. I was flying from Faro to Dublin on an A330-202 on the 10th July 2024. The aircraft is 22 years old so I knew the cabin was going to be a bit aged. However the IFE was quite outdated and my seat felt thin. The IFE had no modern headphone jack, still had physical buttons on it and used the old Aer Lingus shamrock on the screen.  One re-occurring issue I have with Aer Lingus is with the IFE system's map. It is primitive and is completely un-interactive.  Apart from this the IFE is great. It is fast and has a good choice of movies, TV shows, audio, info and games.

Aer Lingus,2,"""being difficult about reimbursement""",25th June 2024,True," We flew from Cleveland, OH to Chicago, IL then Chicago to Dublin and finally to Glasgow. We had the most amazing flight attendant on our way from Chicago to Dublin (Casey-Jade)! When we got to Dublin we found out our flight to Glasgow was delayed twice for 3+ hours. We had issues at the airport from Aer Lingus on what gate to be at, making us go back and further from two gates that were rather far apart. When we were boarding the plane on the tarmac I saw our luggage out on the tarmac to be loaded onto the plane. After boarding the flight, my mom could see from her window that our luggage wasn’t being loaded onto the plane and then the baggage carrier loaded our bags back onto his car to drive away. My mom brought this to the flight attendants attention. Others on the plane then notices the same thing happening to their bags. We asked the flight attendant to do something about this but neither did and the male flight attendant was rude when speaking to us. After continued questioning, the male flight attendant did open the door and asked the man on the ground if all bags for were loaded on the plane, he said yes. Obviously, the baggage carrier on the ground wouldn’t think he missed bags to load. This was all either flight attendant did to help prevent our bags from not making it to our final destination. While the male flight attendant was visibly mad and spoke to us in a very aggressive manner the whole time. We then arrived in Glasgow, without our luggage. We were 2 of 8 passengers who’s luggage weren't loaded onto that flight. We filed the claim at the desk. I explained to the representation that my mom and I were on a guided tour trip and we would be moving from one hotel to the next each day – we would not be at the same hotel for the first 3 or 4 days of our trip. I called to speak to a representative later that day to see if our bags made it on one of the multiple other flights out of Dublin to Glasgow that day. The person I spoke with could not answer this. I asked for a supervisor and was told they needed to call me back. Conversations like this went over for an additional 2 days. I had explained to every single person I spoke with the severity of our situation and urgency in which we needed to get our luggage. I got the run around from every customer service representative and supervisor from the lost baggage team. I could never get a clear answer on what was happening, where my bags were or when they would arrive. No one seemed to care, at all. It was an awful experience and feeling. I finally saw by checking the online form that our bags were picked up. They were picked up by Aviation Operations. They weren't delivered that day. I called Aer Lingus’s customer service again and couldn't get an answer as to why they were not delivered or when they would be. So I reached out to Aviation Operations myself. They initially informed me that they would be delivered the next day which would then put us at a different location, again. After more communication, they told me that having my request upgraded to ‘express’ could get them there the same day. I was appalled to hear that after everything I had communicated to the customer service front line and supervisors that NO ONE had marked this as express already. We did finally get our bags due to my persistent effort but now Aer Lingus is being difficult about reimbursement for all of these issues.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Glasgow via Dublin,June 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

Aer Lingus,1,“quite rude and unhelpful”,10th June 2024,False,I recently flew from Malaga to Dublin with  Aer Lingus on May 16th. Unfortunately after landing I discovered my suitcase had been badly damaged. There were pieces broken off it and scratches all over it. I tried to search the website to see how to lodge a baggage complaint but it’s very difficult to find what to do. So I tried to contact their customer service on May 18th but I could only get a chat bot. I explained everything and this chat bot said someone would contact me as soon as possible. I waited for a phone call or email but nothing came. So on May 27th I called the customer service team and got speaking to a man who told me you have to search for after flight services and then he told me what to do to lodge a baggage complaint. So I did this and I received back a reply stating that I didn’t lodge the complaint in the correct manner within seven days so my claim was void. I explained how I was waiting as I was told someone would contact me however this fell on deaf ears. On May 31st I called customer service again as nobody was replying in my claim. They were quite rude and unhelpful so I asked for a supervisor to contact me which I was told would happen in a few days. I called back on June 5th as nobody rang me. I was told a supervisor would contact me within 24-48 hours. I again called back today (June 10th) as nobody called me. The guy I spoke with today told me the other agents forgot to put a request in for a supervisor to call me but he has done now and one will call me within 24 hours.

Aer Lingus,1,“Incredibly poor customer service”,29th February 2024,False," Customer service? They don't know the meaning of customer service. Literally pulling my hair out trying to even talk to them. They’re a shambles, don't have a clue what there doing and don't care for their customers at all. Cancelled our flight (which was pre booked 9 months in advance) they cancelled it with less than 12 hours notice and this flight was very important to us as we had paid for a very expensive 60th birthday party for my mother which cost over £3000. Hence why the flights were booked 9 months in advance. However Aer Lingus cancelled them not even 12 hours before we were due to fly. They refused a refund at first. Refused to compensate anything at all. Told me they couldn't pay for any hotel expenses etc (when they can as they refunded a friend of mine for her hotel) so shows they don't stick to the rules and discrimination comes to mind as they pick and choose who they want to refund. In the end after more than a month later and endless amounts of emails and I even wrote to them in person and paid £10 to send everything by air mail from England to Dublin. They still haven't provided the refund apart from £26 for extra baggage we paid for. Said the other £216 is on its way, still not received more than a month and still arguing with them over it. We had to pay an extra £700 for alternative flights due to Aer Lingus behaviour. We didn't get an apology or refund or nothing back. They cost us a lot of money. I would not recommend them to anyone and I will never ever use Aer Lingus to fly again. And we are regular travellers who fly every couple of months and always at least 4 of us. Sometimes groups of 10 of us. So they have lost a lot of loyal and genuine customers being my whole family just because they could not acknowledge what they did wrong or even provide a refund for our cancelled flight.

Aer Lingus,1,“they do not value their customers”,28th February 2024,True,"In September 2023, I faced a situation with Aer Lingus that I feel compelled to share, as a stark warning to others considering this airline for their travels. After circumstances beyond my control forced me to cancel a flight I had booked, which cost me over 700 Euro, I was plunged into a customer service nightmare that left me feeling cheated and disrespected. Upon contacting Aer Lingus to discuss my options, I was informed that I would only be eligible for a refund of the taxes, amounting to a paltry 50 Euro. This was a shock to me, given the significant amount I had paid. Seeking a more reasonable solution, I requested a voucher for the full value of the ticket, hoping for some flexibility given the unforeseen nature of my cancellation. However, this request was met with an unwavering refusal, accompanied by a cold explanation that it was “too late” for such considerations. The interaction with Aer Lingus’ customer service was not only unhelpful but also distinctly unkind. At no point did I feel heard or understood; instead, I was left feeling like a mere statistic in their booking system, devoid of any human empathy or understanding. The rigidity and lack of accommodation displayed by Aer Lingus have convinced me that they do not value their customers or consider the complexities of real-life situations that may affect one’s travel plans. This experience has been deeply upsetting, not just because of the financial loss, which is significant, but also because of the realization that Aer Lingus is not an airline you can trust to treat you with fairness or compassion. Their unwillingness to provide reasonable solutions or exhibit a basic level of customer service decency is alarming. I urge anyone considering flying with Aer Lingus to think twice. There are numerous airlines out there that value their customers and understand the importance of flexible policies and compassionate service.

And at the last half and hour another person came and we went to her and done everything but there were queues at security and if that wasn’t enough the boarding pass didn’t scan at security so I had to wait to get my boarding pass back. But onboard it was a great experience. Cabin crew were very friendly. And even during turbulence the pilot was talking on the intercom to say it’s fine. And on Lufthansa that I just flew water was free on Lufthansa but on Aer Lingus you had to pay three euro and they are not supposed to be a budget airline but one thing that was great at the airport was that they waited for everyone.,A320-214,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Dublin,December 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,no

Aer Lingus,1,"""worst airline I have flown on""",6th December 2023,True," Aer Lingus is the worst airline I have flown on. They cancelled a flight to Manchester at midnight and abandoned more than 140 passengers at Barbados airport with no help to find transport or hotel rooms. There were no Aer Lingus staff on the ground and the flight crew and Captain vanished and went to a nearby hotel. The same thing happened the following night when the second flight was cancelled at 10pm. The passengers were treated with contempt. Since then it has been impossible to get any help. The overseas Contact Centre is diabolical. They say they are unable to handle complaints and can't contact anyone senior at Aer Lingus or even the Customer Relations team because they ""have no phone numbers for them,"" This airline gives a bad name to the whole industry and is a disgrace to Ireland as a country.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Barbados to Manchester,December 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,no

My luggage including my friend’s were lumped into one since I had a 23kg baggage allowance. Flying back from Belfast to Birmingham on EI3646 on the 9th of October, however was the complete opposite. This review is not entirely about the baggage but the appalling attitude of the woman behind the check-in desk. I have now flown over 59 airlines in total from 5 star airlines to 2 stars and over a hundred airports around the world from a small airport in Dunedin in New Zealand to the likes of Heathrow and Changi in Singapore, but the attitude of the check-in agent for Aer Lingus at BHD is something that I haven’t encountered anywhere. I’m also a BA Silver Executive Club member (nearly gold now). To say it was rude was an understatement. She treated us like we haven’t flown before. My mate and I were trying to explain that at BHX, they’d let us combine our check-in baggage, but this woman won’t let us and she was argumentative.

Dublin was another big delay which was good otherwise we would have missed our flight. Arriving in Chicago we waited for our luggage only to find that 4 pieces had not arrived. There was no one to there to talk to and just a sign with a website for instructions. The next 10 days and hours and hours on the phone were excruciating as our next assignment was fast approaching. We had to replace many of the tools of our trade. Then when we sought refunds for the things we needed replaced and had no assurance of ever seeing before we left.

I was asked to go to the back of the plane to get some fresh air and see a medic, no medic boarded the plane and whilst I’m sitting there quietly the air hostess appeared with my bags and took them off the plane, I was then told to leave the plane and someone from Aer Lingus would meet me. I was dumped at a doorway and told to find my way to arrivals! Lucky for me a member of Dublin Airport staff took pity on me and assisted. I then discovered that the air hostess had not actually put my kindle paper white back in my bag and even though there was no passenger in the seat next to me, my kindle was never found. Medics were I later found out told to stand down as were no longer needed (so much for passenger care) and the desk when I finally got there was closed. A lovely man called Paul did his best to help me but ultimately I had to find somewhere to spend the night and then had to book a flight with Ryanair the following morning to get home as I should have been at work and could not get home with Aer Lingus. As none of this was my fault I asked for my money back as not only had I paid for a flight that I was not given I’d even paid to upgrade my seat that I wasn’t allowed to use.

The seats are narrow and very hard. There was no entertainment, no screens and no movies, zilch. In theory, you could use their WIFI to watch something on your laptop, but the WIFI did not work. Most transatlantic flights offer free wine but not this one. An annoying detail: the attendant insist you keep your window cover closed, even if there is light out, this was around 6 pm, yet the neon lights are on all the time in the attendant's station.

After about 4 hours of flight, we reached Dublin airport. Despite assurances from the flight crew, we were informed that we missed the Boston flight. The staff's behavior was rude, and they provided false information. They booked me for a flight the next day from Shannon, not Dublin, with a layover in New York. Other passengers faced similar issues. After hours of lies, a staff came to our aid and admitted there were no rooms reserved for us near Shannon. Eventually, rooms were found, but the experience was disheartening. The following day, my Shannon to JFK flight went well, but the JFK to Boston flight with DELTA was delayed by an hour.

The service rep at the airport recommended we book our own flights if we could find any and send in for compensation so that's what we did. She implied we should get some kind of compensation for the flight, hotels and other expenses. We had to stay the night in Heathrow and booked our own flights out the next day. When we submitted everything for compensation they denied everything. I tried 3 times to get them to cover at least a portion of our expenses but they did nothing. also, you cannot talk to customer service, everything is thru email. I have had several flight disruptions over the years and have never had an airline not compensate us for something.

I had to leave home very early for the check-in as this flight departed at 640am. The queue for check-in and bag drop off was very poorly managed from a range of perspectives and created a very poor first impression of the airline. Firstly, there was a visible disagreement between 2 uniformed staff members. A member of staff was unable to use a computer and had to call one of her colleagues for help. This employee was not only unable to use the computer but was unnecessarily abrupt with customers and contradicted herself in the instructions she barked out. She could see one of the bag-drop machines was broken and sent 2 young people and an elderly couple to the machine in question and then ignorantly shouted at the elderly couple when they told her for the second time that the machine was broken. When I used a self-drop off machine, I was rudely spoken to by a man. Passengers ended up helping each other as the staff were of no help. Boarding was functional but not well organised. On this busy flight the staff were almost invisible. When the aircraft arrived into Dublin there was a delay as another aircraft was at the gate. The positive side is that the flight was punctual.

So my option is to spend money on a hotel and Ubers in Dublin while extending my childcare another 36 hours or spend $842 getting myself home from JFK airport.

A supervisor took pity on me and somehow got me on the last flight but we arrived in Edinburgh 5 hours or more late outside of the EU regulations with no food or drink offered or available. Aer Lingus has denied the EU regulation payment saying it’s not covered since  unforeseen circumstances on first rejection and then it was a us domestic originated flight so it isn’t covered (not true since it started in Dublin and arrived late into the States). On flight to Dublin they lost my wife’s suitcase and it didn’t get to us until the 2nd to last day in Ireland, over 72 hours when it’s considered a lost bag, we filed a claim, and not once has anyone acknowledged this reimbursement owed for the modest clothing she had to buy.

In the end I missed my flight and had to reschedule. For Dublin to be the home hub for this airline they were the worst people to deal with. The hub in New York at JFK airport was must nicer and professional. The WIFI did not work in the plane and only half of the screens worked.

For the whole flight, the cabin crew locked off one of the two available toilets. There was nothing wrong with it as the cabin and flight crew used it. Keeping a toilet exclusively for crew use is, in my view, unacceptable. The seat on the A330 is comfortable and I had the best 4 hours of continuous sleep I have ever had in the air. The food offering was, for me, poor except for the snack just after take off with the first drink service. It comprised a pack of five mini, savoury biscuits and a little tub of onion chutney to dip, both of which were delicious and very different from the nuts or pretzels others offer. On the outbound flight, we were offered the traditional juice or champagne prior to take off but no attempt was made to offer this on the inbound flight. The Asian-style beef at dinner had little of the Orient about it. I didn't try the dessert or either of the starters. IFE was available but very limited choice compared to many other carriers. Finally the complimentary wi-fi was somehow not available on this leg but you could pay. Outbound no problem a voucher was given shortly after boarding. Okay, quite a bit of whinging there, and apart from the very comfortable seat the only other positive was that despite delayed take off on both legs the plane arrive on time or a little early.

Aer Lingus,2,"""Never again will I fly Aer Lingus""",14th June 2023,True," We booked a ten-day tour of Ireland thru Trafalgar Tours. The tour started 19 May 2023. We wanted to arrive early and see some of Dublin before the tour started so we booked an Aer Lingus flight from Orlando Florida to Dublin on the 17th of May. Our flight was due to depart at 8:30 PM and arrive in Dublin at 9:30 AM on the 18th of May. (Aer Lingus Flt. 120). We were told that the incoming equipment had been delayed and that we would depart at 9:30 PM. The incoming aircraft arrived shortly after 9 PM followed by a fire truck! We were told we would depart at 10;30 then, 11:30. this went on till 2 AM on the 18th. They said the flight was canceled, but we would be boarded in the morning as soon as the aircraft was repaired. Imagine 300 people scrambling to get their checked luggage and make their way to the check in desk to get a hotel voucher (we found out that they booked the hotel rooms at 9:00 PM that night), madness. We got to the hotel at 4:30 AM. We had three hours sleep and returned to the airport to see if our plane had been repaired, it hadn't. we were told we would be boarding Aer Lingus flight 34 for Manchester, England at 5:45 PM.

We arrived 33 hours late. We had paid for a hotel room in Dublin for the night of the 18 that we didn't get to use, and we missed the complete first day of our tour. We filed a claim with Aer Lingus for $ 600 each for me and my wife per EU rules. We also asked for $220 for the hotel room we had paid for, $174 for meals and $800 for the first day of the tour that we missed out on.

I was told very rudely, you have 2 options, sit in the airport for 17 hours until tomorrow or move to Dublin. But you will then have to have a 3 hour bus journey to Shannon. What is so frustrating is this is a very regular occurrence, receive no apologies, then was made sit on the runway for 2+ hours without being able to purchase so much as a chocolate bar. I have been running from gate to gate like a headless chicken and have has no time to stop for some food. I'm starving. ""No we cannot give you anything to eat/buy until we are in the air"". Waited ages for flight then bus to take off, rushed again, no toilet on bus or time to run to shop. No where to charge phone to arrange a lift. 3 hour cold bus journey starved after that. Awful experience, will never fly Aer Lingus again. Obvious lies all the time, excuses for everything that were not even good ones. We got a free plastic glass of water from a 2 litre bottle and at no stage when people complained did anyone say 'Sorry'. Ryanair has become the new Aer Lingus and Aer Lingus the new Ryanair.

They said that would be another upcharge, which I refused. I requested a refund of the $500 since they didn't deliver what I paid for. They rejected the request.

To my dismay, I discovered a disturbing bug in one of the dishes. This discovery was not only highly unappetizing but also raised serious concerns about the hygiene and quality control standards. Such a glaring oversight in food preparation is simply unacceptable. What adds insult to injury is the complete lack of acknowledgment or apology from any representative of the airline.

I shall start this review by firstly referring to the online booking experience. While the website is clear the added on fees such as seat selection and charges for baggage leave a bitter taste. I was livid to see that some passengers brought aboard bags larger than the one I paid to have in the hold based on the online information. Boarding was not efficient as there was no priority boarding for needy categories of passengers. Moreover the person checking & scanning the boarding pass did not even make eye contact and was using her mobile phone with one hand while scanning boarding passes with the other! This is unprofessional and something I have not seen before! Most of the cabin crew had a low profile with the exception of one very hard working lady who went above and beyond to assist and elderly couple. It was nice that some announcements were made in the Irish language as well as in English. The flight arrived ahead of schedule and disembarkation was efficient but again cabin crew other than the same hard working lady were invisible. The flight was operated by an A320 neo. This was ideal for such a short but very busy flight. The captain made clear announcements and safety was taken seriously.

Through a third party we were able to have our clubs picked up, without the airline even knowing. The customer service staff is ignorant and unhelpful.

Aer Lingus,2,"""over 12 hours of delay""",27th May 2023,True," Our flight from Chicago to Dublin was delayed and our connecting flight to Zürich did not wait in Dublin. No big deal, we thought. Usually airlines would route us to the final destination without much fuss. Not the case with aer Lingus. Aer Lingus doesn’t have relationship with most major airlines. So you are presented with very limited choices. Our best case alternative routing presented was over 12 hours of delay from the original time. We even asked for a direct connection the next day but they didn’t have flights to Zürich on Sunday. So the next flight was two days away. We took the alternate route they provided. We were not provided any compensation or voucher.  We had to take the checked bags out at Ireland and go through immigration to get the rebooking done and had to check in afresh again. They provided boarding passes only until Amsterdam and not to the final destination Zürich. The baggage tag was also to Amsterdam. I raised concern over that. The agent said we should collect our bags again at Amsterdam and recheck and collect boarding passes at Amsterdam at KLM counter. The flight to Amsterdam was delayed by two hours. When we reached Amsterdam, we had to go through immigration and collect the bags again. We did that and when we went to check in the bags, we were told that their system doesn’t show that we paid for the bags and we have to pay again. We paid for 30 kg check in bags. Due to Aer Lingus's fault, we now have to pay again for the baggage (55 euro) and an excess baggage fee of 75 euro. Not only that, we had to visit six different counters to get this issue resolved. We spent well over four hours going from counter to counter with kids and bags. Klm staff asked us to pay them and seek reimbursement from aer lingus. When we contacted aer Lingus via them WhatsApp business account, they asked to register a case at their website and provided a link.

Aer Lingus,1,"""our luggage has not been located""",23rd May 2023,False,"There are lots of choices when booking a flight. We happened to be celebrating a milestone wedding anniversary and booked a trip to Italy. The flight itself was fine. We arrived at the airport in Naples and were the only passengers on a flight of 300+ people to be standing at the baggage carousel when it shut down because all the bags had been picked up by the passengers except for us. Our bags were missing. So now we head over to the missing baggage window and fill out a missing baggage claim form. This is Sunday morning. We make our way to the hotel with the clothes on our back for a week long stay to celebrate our anniversary not sure where our luggage is. We are tired. We have been on two flights for 10 hours. We wake up the next morning and put on the same clothes we arrived in to get breakfast. Never mind that there are new outfits in our luggage that we purchased for this trip that are floating around somewhere. After calling Aer Lingus multiple times and being told our luggage is out for delivery, we logged on to their missing baggage website only to learn our luggage has not been located yet in spite of Aer Lingus agents lying and telling us on the phone our bags were on the way. Was this so we wouldn’t go out and purchase necessary items to change into to keep Aer Lingus lost baggage costs lower. We are now in our 3rd full day in Italy and Aer Lingus still stands by their claim that one bag is out for delivery, when the truth of the matter is they can’t specify where it is en route. This saga will probably continue for us long after we depart Italy in two days. To add insult to injury, Aer Lingus cannot tell us what is acceptable and necessary that we can purchase while we wait hopelessly for our luggage. Talk about being given the run around, reading from a computer screen that the bags are in route, escalating our calls to supervisors who only read the same script on a screen. My Advice to Everyone out there - DO NOT BOOK YOUR FLIGHT through Aer Lingus if you value the peace of mind that you are entrusting a company that values it’s customers and will make a sincere effort to correct an error in a timely and honest manner. Let’s face it, a lot of people are like us, we don’t travel all the time, we spent thousands of hard earned dollars, and to be in Europe for going on four days in the same skivvies we arrived in should not be tolerated by customers - so book with another airlines if you value peace of mind.",A330,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Naples via Dublin,May 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

They are reasonably quick to refund when there has been a problem, reasonably fair in their assessments of grievances and generally better at professional communication than most.

Aer Lingus,1,"""we are left to our own devices""",18th May 2023,True,"Welcome to post covid travel! I can accept many things, especially because of covid. Airline flights cancelled, lack of full staff, the list goes on. So, for this summer expect a whole lot of cancelled flights. So lets look at what a cancelled flight looks like in this post covid era. First off you'll get a message that your flight is delayed. Ok, so we'll just hang out in the club lounge a little longer, have a bite to eat, a beverage and just relax. Maybe an hour later check on how the flight is going and oh my! The gate looks like a scene at a border crossing: Its humid, its hot, there are people laying on the ground, babies are crying. Real hell on earth...well back to club for me! Then 3 hours after our plane should have left they announce flight cancelled. I go the gate and again see a scene of human misery, that's passengers I'm talking about, not Aer Lingus employees, they've booked it for the exits and gone home (probably high-fiving each other with, 'great job today!'). So we are left to our own devices and somehow all wonder to check-in like zombies out of a horror film (and the babies are still crying). An hour passes (it's now 10pm and we have been at the airport since 3pm) and word filters down that our luggage is in baggage claim. Off we all go to pick up our luggage (picture zombies trudging with a suitcase (and I wonder how those zombies with babies picked up their luggage?) Again we are at check-in with no Aer Lingus staff. Finally at 11pm someone who is not Aer Lingus starts to sort through this misery and give us direction, hotel, call this number, etc. And now for the zinger, not once, not at any time did any Aer Lingus staff show any humanity for the 3 or 6 month old babies that were crying. I saw one mother patiently comforting her baby in stoic solitude, showing her character and instilling in her baby what true character is.

Aer Lingus,3,"""shoddy customer service""",18th May 2023,True," The security is amazing so quick it's almost worth the way you are treated on the flight, almost. Going from Dublin to LA we had a engine fault. Totally get it - it could happen to any good airline. We were trapped on the flight for one and a half hours before air conditioning could be turned on. Then we were freezing. After a two hour delay we were off. This was my first long haul with Aer Lingus post covid - a lot has changed. The bar came round once! What you are not told is there is no complementary wine with your meal just a tiny tiny cup of water. Luckily for me I ordered two drinks to see me through to past dinner. Food was OK - as soon as dinner was served the cabin staff disappeared and I mean disappeared! I found them all about 5 hours later literally hiding in the galley. I asked if I could purchase a bottle of water ( gone are the heady days when someone quietly came round the cabin asking if anyone required water on an 11 hour flight) no we have no bottles I was told. Some one took pity on me and gave me one from business class. As a walked back to my seat clutching my bottle other travellers gasped with cracked lips ""where did you get that"" that was going to LA on way back exactly the same issues only I told the line to buy water before boarding. We landed in Dublin to something described as a breakfast burrito (it was hell on earth) and to add insult to injury we were not even offered a coffee! Shame on you Aer Lingus, shoddy shoddy customer service - in case anyone is wondering it was a £750 ticket. This is definitely what I would call a no frills air line.

No drinks trolley coming round offering drinks throughout the flight, the only drink I was offered was with my meal. No duty free offered. No food came around until about one hour into the flight, it seemed as though they heated one meal at a time. Slow is an understatement. On our outward flight, of the 30 seats in business class, there were only 13 seats occupied, yet I still could not have the meal I wanted as they had run out? Food was bland and uninteresting. The staff seemed to be just doing as little as possible, not interested, not friendly at all to anyone really. Got a code for free wifi in Business Class, it did not work, so no free wifi. At JFK when we were boarding our flight, which was delayed by an hour and forty minutes, a ground crew member attempted to open the barrier to allow economy class ticket holders with buggy/prams to board before anyone else did, until another staff member told her that business class passengers should be boarding first. Apart from the roomy and comfortable seat, I felt like I was in economy.

I flew with them last summer our flights were an absolute mess! They rearranged our seats without our permission, contacted them and were told it was fixed back took hours but it was fine. Ended up being rearranged again again without our permission again had to call in and were told it was fixed. When we arrived in Dublin for our transfer one of the family members was put on a completely different flight at a completely different time. The staff in Dublin were rude, they said there was nothing they could do at the gate and we'd have to leave the gate and go to the main desk at the office. After waiting for almost 2hrs because two other non-related flights got cancelled and they only had two people working the desk we were told there was nothing they could do and they don't know why one person was switched even though we had our email confirmations and they could see all the previous flights made. I followed up with their customer service team because this was ridiculous after months they offer a mediocre voucher for our experience. It is been 7 months and I've yet to see this voucher.

Our flight was due to leave at 18.05, they waited until 18.25 to say the flight was cancelled and couldn’t get us on another flight until the following day. We were then told to head back to baggage collection to collect our cases, and proceed to check-in to arrange the hotel. This would have been straightforward if they hadn’t made us wait 2.5 hours to get our bags back. We then had to make our way to the hotel, most of that was guess work, only to find out our so called food voucher wasn’t available for use in any of the hotel restaurants. They tried to palm us off with either fish or curry in a separate room and it wasn’t being served until after 21:30. Travelling with children, this really isn’t a fair deal. We were then informed we had been transferred onto the 06:30 flight the following morning, I mean come on, not eating until after 21:30 with children, then trying to sort cases etc and be up for 03:30 the following morning to make the flight, absolute joke! To make things even more hilarious, my friend was travelling on the Aer Lingus flight to Glasgow around the same time we were due to fly, they were 20 mins from landing and they turned back due to a technical fault. So travelling back 40 minutes was safer than the 20 mins to Glasgow!!

Aer Lingus,6,"""a low-cost basic experience""",28th February 2023,True," There was nothing wrong with the flight itself per-se - it took off and landed on time, generally calm. Terminal 2 security at Heathrow was calm, although amenities and shops quite poor - since Boots closed, you can't buy water anywhere for less than £2 which is extortionate. Boarding felt a bit early, but we didn't take off at departure time as it was quite slow - this was because there was only one gate agent checking in everyone including premium passengers and those requiring assistance, although automatic gates were used. Seats were above average comfortable for short-haul, on the way our was old-style so more padding and quite comfortable but on the way back was slimline but fine for an hours flight time - strangely the seat pocket in front had been sewn up so no where to store small belongings, which felt a tad low-cost despite the premium prices charged for this flight. Cabin-crew weren't especially warm and friendly and seemed rather unmotivated, they did pass through the cabin quickly offering the buy-on-board snacks and drinks but no menu was offered and it was almost like it was just a formality and seemed a bit surprised or put-out that some people actually wanted any like my neighbour in my seat. Buy-on-board products didn't look good quality from looking online, felt very expensive for what they were in comparison to other carriers. My biggest issue though is Aer Lingus charge quite a premium to fly with them against the only other carrier they compete with between the two cities, so they're not anywhere near cheap - yet it feels like a low-cost basic experience. I think even a complimentary snack and some water is the least the should offer as their sister airline BA now do in short-haul economy given the premium charge.

Aer Lingus can no longer provide this service - they booked us onto a British Airways flight but on the 'cheap' seats - with hand baggage only, to the value of approximately GBP150 pounds for all 4 of us. There were checked baggage options available as I asked BA and it still would have only cost 215 pounds compared to the 412 I paid Aer Lingus. Now Aer Lingus reuse to refund me the extra legroom and checked baggage fees. I have to pay again to BA to have 25kg checked baggage x 4 and extra legroom seats are now not available. They take your money, can't provide a service, refuse a reasonable request for refunds, book you on a third of the price seats/flight and pocket my change. Their terms and conditions are the seats/tickets are non refundable - I understand this however my seats / tickets with Aer Lingus are non existent so how do these rubbish non refundable terms and conditions apply to a non existent service?

They always say you have to email but you never receive a response (this after 24 emails over 3 mths and no responses). We flew business and they ran out of food. They offered economy meals. Flight attendants clearly did not like their jobs. The food (when you did manage to get any) was horrible and it was next to impossible to get a second drink, even water. Finally, we arrived in SFO to hear my husband's name called - they put my bag on the flight from Dublin but not his. We were leaving and checked through from Paris. They promised it would arrive next day, next flight. 10 days later it is still listed as tracking and in Dublin. We phoned several times to be told it was still in Dublin as far as they could see. We went several times to the airport and checked Lost Luggage -also finally went a 3rd day to see the same flight coming in and found a helpful man on security who phoned around.

Aero Vip carries out the public service obligation connection between Funchal and the smaller Porto Santo airport located on the island with the same name. The outbound flight was on a vintage (1989) Jetstream 32 turboprop airliner with the return flight being on a slightly older (1987) Jetstream 31. In both cases the safety briefing was carried out by the first officer himself, as the plane does not have any FA on board. The outbound flight left right on time and touched down in PXO just 10/15 minutes later. The plane on the way back arrived late and we left PXO with some 30 minutes of delay, again reaching our destination in slight over 10 minutes. The planes’ interiors are quite worn out but overall the planes gave me the impression of being in a good mechanical shape. If you take this flight to reach the beaches in Porto Santo, as was my case, the whole flight is a really fun and unique retro-experience for aviation enthusiasts which unfortunately comes with a hefty price tag (150 EUR return).

Safety instructions were given as normal and we rocketed out of SVO Moscow.

Naturally I was very concerned about the safety of Aeroflot nowadays as they cannot legally get parts for most aircraft, but we got here.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,5,"""felt very rushed and unpolished""",30th January 2022,True," Aeroflot has set high standards of achieving a 5-star airline status and my expectations significantly increased as a result. Positives included a seamless upgrade from Comfort to Business at LHR, good Plaza Premium lounge, very good miles earning vs redeeming ratio. The A350 hard product is phenomenal, especially on a short London route, and the catering on this flight exceeded the expectations (usually poor hot meal, however, the 4 cheese pappardelle was very good). However, there are two drawbacks on Aeroflot. Firstly, I  dislike Aeroflot’s or SVO’s standard practice of parking planes at the literally remotest ramps possible in -6C and with ice covering the stairs. I understand there maybe logistics issues, but doing so to a premium-heavy flight like London and for their most luxurious widebody is just beyond logic. I am observing that the crew service on the A350 / B777 is poorer than on their other planes. It gave me a feeling that the crew were very much undertrained; as a result the service, although efficient, felt very rushed and unpolished.  I still believe that the Aeroflot Business Class is above any of its European counterparts from the overall package size view, and if one manages to upgrade for miles (amazing redemption value) like I often do, then this product is possibly the best business class. However, full-fare paying passengers might be disappointed, because, in addition to a cutting-edge hard product, for such money, you expect a hospitable and personalised staff service beyond the ‘just tick’ attitude.

As a result I missed my flight arriving 5 minutes late to my gate. Other passengers were at the gate before me and still were not allowed to the flight.

The premium economy service was entirely satisfactory. The seat doesn’t have a lot of recline, but the legroom was fine for a 6’1” (185 cm) person and I was comfortable for the whole eight-hour trip. I liked the food well enough and appreciated having actual metal cutlery (though serving wine in a paper cup seemed a bit déclassé). The entertainment system had quite a wide variety of both movies and music. There was only one W.C. for a cabin of 50+ passengers, which is the only notable demerit that I found.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,1,"""The customer service was extremely poor""",2nd November 2020,False," My flight was cancelled by Aeroflot back in April. We called multiple times throughout April, May and June and I was promised a refund of the full amount. It was obviously not up to me whether to take that flight or not and it is reasonable to expect a full refund. However refund was never provided. I tried to send multiple messages to the airline’s customer service as well with no response. Last week I tried to call Aeroflot customer service. I had to pay for the international call as there are no representatives in Australia where I live. The customer service was extremely poor. To be honest, I have not encountered such poor attitude in years and it was extremely frustrating. The customer service representative could not properly address any of the issues. She said that the only two options are a voucher and reissuing new ticket. Well, I don’t live in Russia or even Europe so there is absolutely no way I can use these options. The reason why I bought a ticket with Aeroflot was that the transfer time was convenient on my way from Rome to Tokyo, I was not even intending to visit Russia. I explained it and no, nothing she was willing to do, just continued quoting new Russian legislation that came into effect half a year after I bought the ticket! I asked to explain how come I was promised a refund previously and was held waiting for months and months and now it’s not an option. She couldn’t explain. She said I can submit complain through the feedback section. I explained that I have tried to communicate the issue through the feedback section already and not getting any response. She said she can’t help with. Then I asked her to connect me to her supervisor and no, she couldn’t do it for some reason. This is the first time ever I couldn’t speak to a customer service manager or a supervisor. Basically the company just decided to keep my money that I paid, go ahead with it and customer service did not care at all. I just lost a lot of money on the international call without any resolution. This situation is absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable. Every other airline I booked with that cancelled flights provided me a refund a while ago, despite COVID-19. Understand there are struggles at the moment and I did accept a voucher from an Australian airline because I can use it living in Australia. But I just can't use an Aeroflot voucher. The ticket wasn’t a cheap ticket either and it was refundable and it is outrageous that I can’t get money back for a ticket that was refundable (and I paid a premium for it to be refundable and have an option to receive a refund). I sent another message to the airline following the call and received the same response about vouchers that is pretty much just their copy paste from the customer service templates. The airline does not care about their customers and reputation and is just exploiting COVID-19 situation to hold customers’ cash for as long as possible (if not indefinite).",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Rome to Tokyo via Moscow,April 2020,,,,,,,1.0,no

All were also immaculately attired and turned out. For a three hour flight, not overly long, they got in three services, a food run, then tea and coffee and duty free and made it look easy. I also loved the Sukhoi Superjet (SSJ100) despite all the stories about it. I chose to fly it deliberately, as I wanted to see for myself what it was like. Great little regional commuter. I found it very comfortable inside with ample leg room and a rear toilet that was huge - larger than on some big wide bodies. Plane was also very clean inside. No IFE but to be expected on short haul regional commutes and didn't phase me and didn't expect any. So my overall experience with Aeroflot from Bucharest to Moscow return, was outstanding and enjoyable and I can't think of anything to mark down.

Lounge access. Fly Attendants very welcoming, helpful and genuine. Space + seat (front row) and economy seat with good width (18') and pitch (32') - Aeroflot is one of the very few Airlines to still give 18 inches width (most nowadays give 17"" or less). Moscow Airport is quite good, the various lounges for Frequent Flyers / business passengers are really excellent. Arrived on time and relaxed to Phuket. Had only once in 3 years a delayed luggage (was delivered 48 hours latter to my door in Paris, free of charge to me).

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,2,"""they are a pure disaster""",27th November 2019,True,"Aeroflot has two faces. When things run smoothly, they are okay, but when you have a problem with them, they are a pure disaster. I flew with my family from Asia to Sweden, via Moscow. Even though we had more than an hour of waiting in Moscow none of our luggage arrived with us in Sweden. We reported it. Aeroflot was extremely unclear about where and when the luggage would come, and they were unable to locate it, until it, different days, arrived in Sweden. It then turned out that one of our hard Samsonite suitcases had a hole in it. It was too big to be acceptable and I therefore made a claim to Aeroflot, in accordance with their procedure. They answered me that I should send original documentation to Moscow. I did so, but was careful enough to make copies of everything. A couple of days later they just closed my claim, without any further explanations. After that I have contacted them a large number of times, making new claims referring to the original one and so forth. When they noticed that I did not give up, they tried a new strategy – to not answer. After months of waiting, I contacted them again, and actually got an answer: that they had increased their own handling time, according to the Russian law (they said), with another 30 days. Then it was silent again. Next time I contacted them they told me to make a new claim, since the first one was not treated! When I said I did not want to they referred to the Swedish Aeroflot office, which in turn told me to send the claim to them. But when the Swedish office answered to my claim it was with the information that they would not handle the case. Indeed, I have to communicate with the Moscow office, they told me. Aeroflot clearly have no intention whatsoever to give me any compensation. If you think that your suitcases and luggage is not so much to care for, you could buy a ticket with Aeroflot, but if you have any luggage that has a value you should think more than once - and then use another air flight company.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Hanoi to Stockholm via Moscow,July 2019,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

There was very little information provided. They were arranging a hotel to stay for the night, but could not announce that until 22:00. They then took the delayed passengers upstairs and left us there for a further hour with no information. They then collected us, but we then wait another hour until the coach finally came to take us to the hotel. Once at the hotel, they let us in, in small groups. We then had to be paired with strangers in one room, but that took forever. We finally made it into a hotel room at 02:00 with the flight scheduled for 05:55. They were arranging collection at 04:00, so with only 2 hours to rest, it was a terrible experience. The staff were apathetic toward all the passengers affected.

Flights board well in advance of departure and airplanes, when loaded, depart. Schedules are not padded for time and flight time is accurate. Premium Economy is excellent value with comfortable seats, decent amenities, and big, filling meals. The only alcohol served is beer and wine; drinks service is followed immediately with meal. Oddly, the second meal on both transatlantic flights is served 3 hours before arrival which interrupts the chance for some hours of sleep. Announcements are continuous and interrupting; first, pre-recorded Russian/English followed by crew Russian/English announcements repeating the same message. Crews are typical, ranging from disinterested senior to pleasant, willing, smiling junior cabin staff. Services SVO-TSE-SVO on Airbus equipment with no IFE are similar with nice food, disruptive announcements and decent level of comfort.

Having pre-registered online, I did not manage to check in my luggage until the end of registration. When it was my turn, they suggested that I fly without baggage. As a result, my granddaughter, 14 years old, who had no luggage, flew out alone, while I reissued a ticket at the ticket office the next day (August 8), for which I paid 5520 rubles. In addition to me, other people with similar stories crowded around the ticket office and they all asked the same questions: “Why don't they announce the end of registration? Why are company employees working so slowly?” I want to ask one more question: ""Why do the tickets indicate only the time of boarding the plane, but there is no time to complete the registration?""

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,1,"""handled so poorly""",7th August 2019,True," New York to Tel Aviv via Moscow in June 2019. Worst experience I've had with an airline. My flight from JFK to SVO, was continually delayed by Aeroflot without explanation. Even though the boarding time was never changed, we boarded over an hour late, then were told to get off after 80 minutes sitting on the plane without any sort of communication from Aeroflot staff about what was happening. They eventually claimed that they were trying to solve ""mechanical issues"" with the plane while we continued to sit on the plane. As I later heard airport staff commenting on, I have no idea why they boarded all of the passengers when they had clearly not solved the issue to begin with. To make matters worse, despite the flight taking off from New York (with many American and English-speaking passengers on board), most of the announcements were only made in Russian. After we got off, we were told that we would need to wait for up to 3 more hours to be notified about the status of our flight. We waited for almost 2 more hours before they canceled the flight - but, in fact, they did not admit to canceling the flight - instead, they claimed to have ""delayed"" the flight for a full 24 hours! Many passengers, myself included, were upset and frustrated, but this was not the end of the complete botching of this flight by Aeroflot. They seemed to have no planned response to this scenario. They herded us all upstairs to claim our luggage, and then had us wait in obscenely long lines to check in with two Aeroflot staff members  to claim an updated ticket for the 24-hour-delayed flight and/or a hotel voucher. After already being delayed for hours, we had to wait on these lines for at least an additional 1-2 hours. The worst part of this whole disaster was that Aeroflot claimed that they were not rebooking anyone's flight because the flight had not technically been canceled, it had been delayed (according to them). Most reasonable airlines release tickets once a flight has been canceled (as this one effectively had been, clearly) so that passengers can rebook on other flights, but Aeroflot was able to get around that by ""delaying"" the flight.  The staff that were handing out the new tickets and hotel vouchers were quite rude and displayed no sympathy for customers who had been treated so poorly by the airline already (I understand they were dealing with many angry customers, but they still could have at least apologized on the behalf of the airline, which they did not). Sure enough, even though I had a program in Tel Aviv that required my presence before the ""delayed"" flight's arrival, Aeroflot would not rebook my flight. I was lucky enough to have a travel agent for this trip, and they were able to demand that Aeroflot rebook my flight to another airline after a lot of frustration on their part, requiring me to rush to another airport after a whole night of no sleep. The entire experience was handled so poorly and unprofessionally from beginning to end that I will never fly with Aeroflot again.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Tel Aviv via Moscow,June 2019,,,,1.0,,,1.0,no
Aeroflot Russian Airlines,4,"""my luggage did not arrive""",30th July 2019,True," Madrid to Guangzhou via Moscow. I would just like to say that the way this airline schedules this flight is a recipe for stress and disaster. A friend of mine flew the same route and had the same thing happen to her. She had given me a heads up that I would have to go from one end of the Moscow airport to the next end in order to attempt to make my flight. She also warned me that my luggage would probably not arrive. She knew this as she had taken the same route two weeks before I did. The flight from Madrid to Moscow flight 2501 arrives at 5:50 PM at terminal D. Then you have to get though security to get to terminal F in order to take flight 220 which leaves at 7:05 PM from gate 57 at terminal F, which is the second to the last gate. I literally ran from one terminal to the next and then asked the security attendant if she could take me to the front of the line in order to make my flight. If I had not ran and had not asked to be taken to the front of the line I would have missed my flight. Once I arrived in Guangzhou, I was told my luggage did not arrive and would be delivered the next day. So, why have a route so tight that will cause passenger's luggage to always arrive a day late?

I also noticed stewards and stewardesses on the domestic planes had become more professional. The meals served were very welcome and tasty.

As a Frequent Flyer (GoldMember) with Aeroflot for nearly 3 years, all I can say is that I'm very satisfied with them. Flight Attendants are genuinely welcoming and helpful, aircraft (usually Airbus) are recent, seats have a generous width & legroom (Frequent Flyers are entitled to a Space+ Seat with extra leg room, free of charge), food & wines onboard and in the business lounges are good and prices are overall competitive. You may sometimes have a flight delayed (snow at Moscow Airport in the winter, etc) - but I've experienced that Aeroflot will never let you down. They will provide drink, lunch, even hotel, and next available flight. A few months ago my flight from Bangkok to Paris was delayed, Aeroflot put me on the Thai Airways direct flight in the same day / evening and gave me a 4 star hotel + meals for the 8 hours waiting time. Moscow Airport is good, and has everything you need - restaurants, cafés, bars, hotels, wifi, vending machines. I had my luggage delayed - only once in 3 years - it was delivered to my door in Paris 48 hours later, free of charge to me. Overall a very good airline and I strongly recommend Aeroflot.",A330,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Moscow,July 2019,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,yes

Traveling with 3 kids, they bumped me off my business class confirmed flight, without my consent and without a forwarding confirmed flight. 4 hours waited at the international ticketing desk, in an area with no water/food, with 3 young kids, since according to Russian law to enter the terminal you need to clear immigration and security. Requested/demanded to meet supervisor, was told by staff that they were in another building! Finally get into the terminal and then spend next 10 hours at another information desk in the terminal. With 3 kids this was absolutely one of the worst travel experiences, especially since I paid for business class to have the comfort. They finally put us up in one of the worst hotel rooms imaginable (available only at 10pm), with no ability to upgrade (since we were not in the ‘Russian section’ of the hotel). We were finally able to get out of Moscow the following day, 24hrs later. No response from Aeroflot customer service. Don’t expect one. Don’t think they care either. Just a piece of advice: shell out the extra $200 and get another airline into Delhi.

I have flown Aeroflot 9 times between Almaty and Copenhagen via Moscow in the last 5 months and my luggage has arrived on the same flight I have arrived on less than 15% of the time. Furthermore, it often does not arrive for 48 hours, which is incredibly inconvenient. And on the Almaty end, I have to go to the airport myself (or get a courier) to pick it up.

The staff was continuously smiling but that does not help. Aeroflot claims that they have a lost luggage tracking system but it doesn’t work. Calling customer support is pointless. I called like 20 times and I was every time disconnected while waiting on the line. The staff in Phuket promised to deliver bags tomorrow to our hotel.

Most of travelers were Indians returning home, so it may have played a role, as I was among the very few required to show a visa to enter India. Plane is a bit old, but in good shape.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,1,"""beyond bad customer service""",27th June 2019,True," Last week my wife and son flew Aeroflot with a 1hr 20 min connection through Moscow Sheremetyevo. The flight from Almaty touched down in Moscow on time, but passengers had to wait 20 minutes for the terminal bus to arrive. The stewardess assured my wife that if the connecting flight was missed, ""they will give you seats on the next flight."" The plane was served by only one bus, so everyone had to wait for all passengers on the plane to disembark before the bus ever left for the terminal. Transit passengers in Terminal D must pass through a security and passport control check before entering the terminal. By the time my wife and son cleared the security check, the boarding gate for their connecting flight to JFK had closed. Nevertheless, they made all haste to the departure gate, hoping they would be allowed to board, but they were too late. Aeroflot agents told my wife that the missed connection was her fault and she would have to pay full fare for the onward journey, more than $1,700. My wife had only a little over $900 on her card. I transfered the money to my wife's card so she could buy her and my son's ticket. This kind of mistreatment goes far beyond bad customer service.

Aerolineas Argentinas,1,"""do not recommend choosing this airline""",18th September 2023,False," Our recent trip with Aerolineas Argentinas on the 6th, 7th and 11th was a deeply disappointing experience. Both on the way there and on the way back, we faced a series of problems that negatively affected our trip. On the way out, our scheduled flight to Buenos Aires from Guarulhos was scheduled to take off at 10:50 am. However, we were abruptly informed of a delay with no clear guidance on how to proceed. During the agonizing wait time, we received conflicting information about departure times, and promises of meal vouchers were not fulfilled on time. This forced us to spend our own money on food. To make matters worse, our flight was ultimately cancelled, and we faced difficulties in reaching Aerolineas employees for clear information. After an exhausting wait, we finally received a voucher for a hotel. However, the instructions for finding the bus to the hotel were confusing, and company staff seemed to be disrespectful of our situation.  Upon arriving at the hotel, we discovered that Aerolineas Argentinas had only paid for the outward ticket, leaving us with unexpected expenses for the return to the airport. The following night, we faced another long queue at the airport and missed our connection to El Calafate, without any hotel paid for by the company. We were instructed to request accommodation at a hotel in Buenos Aires, but were only given a voucher for breakfast at the airport. This resulted in an extra 10 hours of waiting at the airport, putting a damper on our planned tour. On the return trip, we faced an additional problem, as the stopover in Córdoba was not informed on the ticket, resulting in a 1-hour delay upon arrival in São Paulo. In short, our experience with Aerolineas Argentinas was highly unsatisfactory due to delays, cancellations, lack of clear communication and inadequate support from the company. We do not recommend choosing this airline for future travel.  Nossa recente viagem com a Aerolineas Argentinas nos dias 6, 7 e 11 foi uma experiência profundamente decepcionante. Tanto na ida quanto na volta, enfrentamos uma série de problemas que afetaram negativamente nossa viagem. Na ida, nosso voo programado para Buenos Aires a partir de Guarulhos estava marcado para decolar às 10h50. No entanto, fomos informados abruptamente de um atraso sem orientações claras sobre como proceder. Durante o tempo de espera angustiante, recebemos informações conflitantes sobre o horário de partida, e promessas de vouchers para refeições não foram cumpridas a tempo. Isso nos obrigou a gastar nosso próprio dinheiro para alimentação. Para piorar, nosso voo foi finalmente cancelado, e enfrentamos dificuldades para encontrar funcionários da Aerolineas para obter informações claras. Depois de uma espera exaustiva, finalmente recebemos um voucher para um hotel. No entanto, as instruções para encontrar o ônibus para o hotel foram confusas, e funcionários da companhia pareciam desrespeitar nossa situação.  Ao chegar ao hotel, descobrimos que a Aerolineas Argentinas havia pago apenas a passagem de ida, deixando-nos com despesas inesperadas para a volta ao aeroporto. Na noite seguinte, enfrentamos outra fila longa no aeroporto e perdemos nossa conexão para El Calafate, sem nenhum hotel pago pela companhia. Fomos instruídos a solicitar alocação em um hotel em Buenos Aires, mas recebemos apenas um voucher para café da manhã no aeroporto. Isso resultou em 10 horas extras de espera no aeroporto, prejudicando nosso passeio planejado. Na viagem de volta, enfrentamos um problema adicional, já que a escala em Córdoba não estava informada na passagem, resultando em um atraso de 1 hora na chegada a São Paulo. Resumindo, nossa experiência com a Aerolineas Argentinas foi altamente insatisfatória devido a atrasos, cancelamentos, falta de comunicação clara e apoio inadequado da companhia.

Aerolineas Argentinas,6,"""they tend to leave on time or early""",20th March 2023,True," One of the best things about AR is that they tend (in my experience on 3 flights) to leave on time or early. Boarding by zones is usually enforced and it works; boarding starts early. Staff on board seem tired, are never well-groomed and generally bored. Friends / other staff seem to be upgraded to Business class regularly on board. Catering is very basic usually - example: ""Breakfast"" flight of 3.5 hours, leaving at 05:10 served a cup of still water and a small ""health"" bar. No options like other menu for sale items. Crew disappeared after service. Cabin baggage seems to have no item number control but is weighed rigorously. Free checked baggage allowance is 15kg, unlike most other carriers throughout the world, and carry-on is 8kg. This can be a trap for international guests who usually travel with around 23kg checked baggage allowance. Overweight is charged for on the spot.",B0eing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ushuaia to Buenos Aires,March 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,no
Aerolineas Argentinas,1,"""still haven't received my money""",10th February 2023,True," Worst experience with an airline, ever! Completed booking, completed payment with my bank and got forwarded back to a website that said ""error"". No confirmation, no tickets received but the money was gone. Called with customer service and got disconnected a total of 6 times while being on hold. When I finally did speak to someone, she informed me there was a booking with reservation number but something on their side went wrong with the payment. She gave me the reservation number and on their website I could find my flight details. But still no tickets. I had to e-mail the ventasonline department who would be able to provide me the tickets. The communication with ventasonline was pointless. They first told me my booking didn't exist and I should book a new flight. I showed them a print screen of my bank payment and the booking with the reservation number and then it all of a sudden did exist, they would write me back about a solution for the money or tickets but they never did. Called with customer service again and they would all say something different or that I had to call back in an hour so they would know more. Did that a total of 4 times when I just lost my patience and the only thing they told me I could do was write an official complaint. As a reply, I received an automated e-mail telling me to contact customer service, so basically super pointless and you're just going around in circles with no one knowing how to help you get either your money back OR give me the damned flight tickets. I always book direct with an airline so that this stuff doesn't happen, but Aerolineas Argentinas apparently doesn't care about their clients and actual customer service. It has been 3 weeks now since booking and still haven't received my money. They tried to make me book a new ticket before receiving the money back but of course I don't have any trust with them anymore so booked with another airline (Air France) and everything went fine. This was my first experience with Aerolineas Argentina and for sure my last. Will avoid flying with them at all costs. By the way, because I paid with credit card my money is safe. I got confirmation from my bank and credit card provider that I was in my right and would receive money back via them.

We paid business so you mean to tell me there’s even more of a price for seat choice even when you can’t see it online?) Then after an hour and a half wait at the passport control security line (no one seemed to be working at all) an hour and a half delay they had flagged my wife’s boarding pass and made her - a business customer - wait until the entire plane boarded ahead of her before they would let her on the flight. She got on the plane crying. Then the flight attendant was rude about it. I am disgusted and we will never fly this airline again.

The airline confirmed a refund was due under the fare conditions and would be paid within 120 days in December 2022.

The staff had a distinct hands-off attitude and any requests were ignored. I was told they would reboot the entertainment system.

The sales office wouldn't issue a new ticket for me as it is ""impossible"" to fly today now, the earliest flight available is in 2 days which is unacceptable. 3) Awful service from staff - I complained ""how am I supposed to know?"" that they would remove my 5th flight because I missed my 4th one (they are 1.5 days apart), the staff responded ""now you know"" - The staff even scolded me for not arriving to the airport earlier.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Buenos Aires to Sao Paulo,December 2021,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,no

The onboard entertainment was non-existent and no one was watching any of the few movies offered.

We were not informed until after check in and the only information about the delay was on flight departure monitors in the departure lounge. In spite of having a long haul, international flight connection with Air France (a SKYTEAM partner airline) on arrival in Buenos Aires, Aerolineas staff showed no concern that we might miss the connection and when asked whether it was necessary to change terminal in Buenos Aires to make the connection gave erroneous information. (We were told it was necessary to change terminal when in fact it was not). On arrival in Buenos Aires we had 59 minutes to check which terminal our onward flight was departing from and make our connection. No assistance of any kind was given by Aerolineas staff. We made our connection but our luggage did not, inspite of being checked through to its final destination on check in. We understand that our luggage has followed on a later Aerolineas flight, via Madrid, but we have yet to receive it. We received an email on return home from Aerolineas Argentinas, sent on the same day of departure, 3 hours after the flight should have left Cordoba and actually at around the time of arrival in Buenos Aires.

By contrast, we flew them many years ago where food and beer/wine was complimentary. They have made a decision to go cheap, and it shows in virtually all aspects of the experience of enduring their product. In the US, this would be like flying Spirit, or in Europe, this would be like flying Ryanair. Yes, it is that bad - and I am not prone to exaggeration. At least Spirit and Ryanair don't pretend to be full-service airlines. Aerolineas does, which makes this is even more infuriating. Like I said, virtually all the domestic routes in Argentina are via Latam and Aerolineas. On top of that, almost all the flights go through Buenos Aires city airport (which is actually quite nice). But that means you will have a layover if you are going from one city to another within Argentina that does not include BA.

They were essentially no frills and provided the mere basics on a flight. Granted, on a 1 hour flight Air France provides a drink and a croissant or similar pastry, whereas only drinks are provided with the same flight time. For a three hour flight, only a snack mix packet was served. Check in is very fast, boarding passes printed almost immediately, but the lines are long and people seem to turn up very late for their flights often, which means a lot of queue cutting. Boarding is mostly a mess, but bearable. Compared to LATAM’s lines though, Aerolíneas’ lines are relatively short. The 737MAX I flew was amazing. The engines were extremely quiet and the windows were large and gave a great view. The seat is the same as China Airlines. Legroom reasonable for short flights. One thing I am critical about, is that overhead bin space is very scarce. People sometimes have to store stuff 3-5 rows in front or behind them.

The flight: late, in a dirty plane, the hostesses jostle, splashes and the breakfast is served by running because it seems that it is already very late to do so and for good reason, we land almost at the same time. Add to that the difficulties to pay a ticket on the site, the total lack of communication (no response on any media available), that's a lot for the same company. In short, we are far from paradise.

I finally managed to book a flight connecting through their hub in Aeroparque in Buenos Aires. The day before the flight, I managed to check in online after only the second attempt, for the system crashed only once. The bag drop, boarding and flight went reasonably smoothly. However, economy seats are small even for a 5'9"" person. In flight entertainment was non existent. On board catering options were bland for a 3 hour plus flight. Connecting in Aeroparque, the international connections terminal is more like a holding pen for tourists with a duty free. Dull uncomfortable seats and one catering option with plenty of microwaveable foodstuffs. Second flight went smoothly, pretty quick hop. On the way back, something I have never seen on any airline belonging to an alliance happened: upon trying to ship a box of fragile items, which I have done numerous times in the past with several airlines (even low costs), the check in personnel refused to do so claiming the airline did not ship fragile items. In the end I had to rearrange the fragile items inside my hand luggage and ship it, and carry a card box full of garments that I had to take out of the bag through two flights and an overnight stay at the airport, all while expecting the worst to my luggage. Fortunately, a rigid bag and smart packing with clothes assured the items arrived in an almost intact state.

We are on a 28-day South America Tour from Australia totalling 15 flights ( 13 with Latam and 2 with air Argentina) and the Latham tickets stated 23kg by 2 pieces baggge per person while the Air Argentina tickets stated one piece without specifying the weight. My wife and I had one piece each of 21kg and no carry on luggage. At check in counter today we were told that the limit per person was 15kg so we must pay 1300 Pesos ( approx 40 USD) and the bags went straight onto the conveyor belt without allowing us to reduce the weight by carrying on some items. We have travelled extensively two to three trips each year and never had a 15kg limit. The airline should have specified the limit if it was below the norm and offered the passenger the option of carry on if over limit at check in.

Flights from San Luis to Buenos Aires were cancelled throughout the day blaming ""meteorologic conditions"", even though there was nothing unusual and flights were flying everywhere else with no problem. Customers were advised about the cancellations just minutes before the flight departure (via email), leaving everyone in limbo. When calling customer centre, they were very rude, and said that the tickets did not qualify for reimbursement, only could be rescheduled for another day. Of course, they wouldn't pay accommodation or anything else either. When trying to discuss options with them, they simply hang up. Finally, many passengers opted to take the bus and claim the money later on (good luck with the claim, anyway). Unfortunately, they have the monopoly of many flight routes in the country and there is no competition, so they charge whatever they like for a very poor service.

This was a short 1.5 hr flight but international never the less. I require assistance now and this airline provided it with care to attention and in a dignified manner. Check in is good, you receive an email 24 hours prior ""looking forward to seeing you"" and even a slightly overweight bag was checked in with a wink. How contrasting to my recent Norwegian experience at LGW. Nice clean plane, welcoming well groomed cabin crew along with a standard seating plan. Basic but complementary snack served by very pleasant crew who didn't seem to struggle with English. On time and disembarking with assistance well managed.

The Austral flights were actually better - the Embraer planes are more comfortable and roomy than Aerolineas Argentinas 737s (which looked new but were a bit cramped) and the Embraer seats even have small entertainment screens (can be hard to get earphones though).

My initial flight with the company was okay, if nothing to write home or review about; however my attempted trip back was horrible. The flight was cancelled. I received only a notice the late night before with no explanation. I had no way of getting information as it was a weekend and they do not have weekend hours. When I went to the airport I was informed there were no flights due to a strike. Now while this may have effected more than one airline they did not offer a refund or remedy, or even an apology or sympathy for their clients. I was one of the lucky ones that got in before they left at 2 pm and basically every other passengers had to learn via word of mouth why and how long (5 days before reschedule) they had to wait.

Aerolineas Argentinas,1,"""the worst I've come across""",15th December 2017,True," I flew Aerolineas on a two week trip with my family from JFK --> Buenos Aires --> Bariloche --> Mendoza --> Buenos Aires --> JFK. I was always a little annoyed with them. I waited on the phone for 30 minutes the day before my flight to reserve seats for the flights and when I showed up to the airport they had no record of my phone call (even though I had gotten an email with seat confirmation) and they had already given away our seats. Given that we had an international flight on our itinerary, we were entitled to two checked bags for each of our flight legs, and every single time they tried to charge us and we had to remind them that we got two free bags - I think they were trying to dupe us. What was most frustrating was that they cancelled our flight home with just over 24 hours advance notice because of a ""technical difficulty"" with the plane, and instead of having the direct flight from Buenos Aires to JFK that we paid for, they re-booked us (after 1 hour on hold) on a flight to New Jersey. I had a connection from JFK to Boston that I obviously missed, and ended up having to pay for another very expensive flight. I filed a claim and never heard back. I called once to follow up and after 45 minutes on hold I was promised that all claims were addressed within 22 days. 22 days came and went and I never heard back again. I made four additional follow-up phone calls, and each time I was on hold from anywhere from 10 to 45 minutes before I could speak to someone. Every person I spoke to gave a different explanation - from this is the wrong phone number to claims take 2 months (not 22 days) to call Expedia. When I finally started asking to speak to supervisors, two times I was actually hung up on. It is ridiculous that I paid for a flight to JFK, they cancelled it, offered me a flight to another airport, and when I declined, I can't get my money back.

On the first of these flights, I managed to miss my flight after not hearing the announcement of a late change in the boarding gate. Totally my fault, but Aerolineas put me on the next flight straight away with no extra charge. So had a good first impression of them. The staff all had decent English (which can be rare in Argentina), the interior of the planes are very spacious when compared with what I'm used to from European airlines and the in-flight services were great.

No complaints whatsoever, brand new, clean planes and enjoyable service both on the ground and in the air. Complementary catering absolutely sufficient for a 3 hour flight with 2 ham/cheese sandwiches, soft drinks and coffee on offer. The only inconvenience was that my reservation number (ticket issued by Lufthansa) wasn't recognized by AR, hence I was unable to make online check-in and reserve seats for the GIG-AEP leg upfront.

Aerolineas Argentinas,3,"""I expect friendly service""",30th August 2017,False," Flew Buenos Aires to Miami. Has to be the worse product flying from South America to the US.

Amenity kit very basic and neither the bag or products were branded (vs Coke Hann on AA, Tumi on Delta, Ferragamo on LATAM etc) Food - much less than basic. On the return I was better off having a quick meal at the airport than on the plane. Service - here's my major concern, if I'm paying a lot for business class, I expect friendly service and attention to detail. Anything I wanted I had to ask for it, they would take my glass of wine while they were still half empty and wouldn't ask if I wanted a refill. I had my food tray done for a long time before they picked up Entertainment - basic, ~30 movies (most of them old or Argentinian films). Forget about noise cancelling headphones. Overall impression: I would definitely avoid Aeroloneas as much as I could. I decided to fly with them since I'm a Delta Diamond and wanted to get them miles and Delta only has an overnight flight from ATL to EZE This airline is way overdue for a makeover.

The only disappointment was the catering. Dinner on the way down was served sloppily (congealed olive oil, no s&p, cling wrap on the dishes) and really unappetizing. And what's with the generic and generically tasting ""red or white?"" wine service? Shouldn't the flagship airline of this wonderful wine country take some pride and feature the best of their production?

The only reason why we were helped was that we complain so much and remained at the check-in window requesting somebody to help us with our flights, we had to ignore the negative treatment by some of the staff and their management and just held our position until someone decided to help us and put us on a flight - we arrived to our destinations after losing 1 day on our holiday; and upon our return discovered that after that whole situation Aerolineas Argentinas cancelled our return flights which had nothing to do with the original flights impacted by the strike.

Rio de Janeiro to Buenos Aires (Aeroparque): Aircraft used was a fairly new Boeing 737-800, flight was on time, crew was friendly, decent leg room and the food provided to us was very good (nice sandwich with a traditional argentine alfajor cake) and a good choice of beverages. Nothing really to complain about this flight. Buenos Aires (Ezeiza) to New York (JFK): Aircraft used was a brand new Airbus 330-200. Very modern plane with LED ambience lighting, good entertainment screens with a good selection of movies and music. Sounds great so far right? Well, the downfall begins with the amount of leg room Aerolineas Argentinas have on this plane. I take long haul flights at least 3 times a year and have had experiences with various airlines but I have never seen a plane with such little space as this one. It was really uncomfortable the whole time because of the limited leg room (I am 1,79 cm). Unlike my other flight on this trip with Aerolineas, the food served for dinner was horrible, I didn't eat it at all, worst food I have ever seen on a long haul flight and I heard other passengers complaining about it as well. Breakfast was decent but still overall very disappointed. Crew was uncaring and only offered water during the meal service; not a single time did they pass around the cabin offering water to passengers. My final thoughts? Regional and medium distance flights, Aerolineas does a pretty good job. Stay away from their Long Haul flights though.",Boeing 737-800 / A330-200,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,GIG to JFK via AEP / EZE,December 2016,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no
Aerolineas Argentinas,1,"""would never recommend""",25th November 2016,False, Santiago to New York via Buenos Aires with Aerolineas Argentinas. Terrible experience. The flight attendants were rude and not helpful. The seat was small and extremely difficult to sleep in for even a few hours. Worse than the actual flight was the online booking experience. When I landed in NYC I had to transfer to Newark and I didn't realize that in the booking process. So I had to pay $31 to take a bus to another airport after I already landed in JFK. I called Aerolineas to ask for help and I had maybe the single worst customer service rep I've ever dealt with.  Aerolineas Argentinas is terrible.

No notification at the airport was given in English and so some passengers were unaware of what was going on. Staff at the airport initially said the delay could be up to 48 hours.

Aerolineas Argentinas,4,"""you get a disapproving reply""",5th June 2016,False," Flew Buenos Aires Aeroparque to Santiago de Chile with Aerolineas Argentinas; to use up some of my Air France miles. Tried to check-in for my flight from Buenos Aires on their web site, which didn’t work, probably because my reservation code was that of Air France and not Aerolineas Argentinas. When calling Aerolineas Argentinas, in order to find out the reservation code I should use for making the check-in on-line, after a very long wait I ended up talking with the most rude agent I’ve ever encountered. According to her I should have never called AR for this matter since I hadn’t used them for my initial booking. Furthermore, she accused me several times during the call for interrupting her, when I simply tried to explain to her that all I wanted to know was the reservation code that they must have for my reservation in their system. She kept on repeating that she does not work for Air France and eventually, she just hang up! So far so good for Skyteam! Worried about what may be next, I arrived at the airport two hours before departure, to find a nearly empty check-in line. So far, so good! Boarding took place relatively easily, bearing in mind we're in Argentina although by a single bus for a full B-737. Once airborne, a sandwich box and coffee/soft drinks were offered, but of course one shouldn’t ask for beer or wine (despite being a country producing so many great wines), as all you get is a disapproving reply from the cabin crew stating that they don’t serve them on “regional” flights. Well, if their region extends to flights over two hours, I wonder, who made up that policy!

Aerolineas Argentinas,7,"""biggest criticism was check-in""",3rd April 2016,False," I recently flew from Bogotá to Buenos Aires and back on Aerolineas Argentinas. I was not sure what to expect, because reviews are very mixed. Both stretches were flown on their A340. On the outbound route, the seats were very old/outdated, although reasonably comfortable. The in-flight system was very limited with just 4 movies and not the best. On the inbound flight we had a different plane and the seats looked much better, although overall they were the same type, but the video screens were much larger. There was also a bigger choice in movies. On both flights the cabin crew was very attentive and pleasant. The meals, although quite abundant, were mediocre in taste, and in both cases, something or the other was forgotten (like the dressing). Bread was cold and/or stale. My biggest point of criticism was the check-in. I had a carry-on weighing 12.3 kilos. First at the counter in Bogotá they made a big fuss over size, but this particular TUMI bag does fit maximum accepted standards. They insisted I fit it in the thing to measure it and when they saw for themselves it did meet size requirements, they insisted to weigh it and told me to either take out the 2.3 kilos or have it checked. This when on Copa and Avianca they let me take it in on board in Economy, no questions asked, and this was business! On the inbound flight they had 3 counters in Buenos Aires with SkyPriority signs, but all 3 were unstaffed. The last check-in agent just walked away with leaving passengers in the SkyPriority line without saying anything. When I complained to the girl who did check me in at an economy counter, she said I had arrived just during a schedule change (how weird!). All in all it was a mixed bag with the actual flight a much better experience than the experience on the ground. To me their way of dealing with business class passenger in the check-in procedure leave much (!) to be desired. They did not treat us special, on the contrary.

My suitcase was 18kgs but the ground stewardess told me that I don't have to pay for it, 18kgs is no problem at all.  I reserved a window seat (5F) and when I came to that place, only 5D was available. My neighbor was a crying baby. In that moment I thought that this was going to be a worse flight. Then a man came to me if I wanted to change seats because he was the father of the crying baby. So: yes please. Still no window seat and I tried to explain that it was rude to take my windowseat, but I don't think he understood.

When the seat in front of you is reclined, you have the tray table pitted against you stomach, even if you are not fat. The flight attendants should ask everyone to sit upright when serving meals on the A330. Rows are so close that it is impossible to get up from your seat normally. One must slide to the end and climb out. I have flown this aircraft before and they are all the same in Economy - horrible. Considering how packed the flight was, the flight attendants were excellent. The food was mediocre with two choices: pasta or beef, and very small servings.

I tried first two - all tasted the same, bland, boring, over cooked. No cocktail service at all, as only whisky is available. Good wines.

We had the full Monty flying Aerolineas. But the staff handled us well. Flight out left on time but no accommodations for Sky Priority passengers. Charge the gate at JFK was more like it. The food was very good. Service is prompt in that every flight attendant worked to get the job done so they could disappear. We liked how they gave us 3 options for our meals. The ice cream for desert and/or cheese plate were fantastic. And it is true they don't offer mixed drinks. For water they gave us a bottle for the over night flight. Breakfast was again very prompt well presented and the crew when prompted did go the extra step. On the return our child's vegetarian meal was missing. The crew promptly reviewed the menu and told us additional items we could choose from. For the return our flight was changed to add a stop at BRC. At which time we were notified our return to JFK was delayed from 11 pm to 6 am. Sky Priority line did nothing to help us here. We had to suffer with the rest. However they did rebook our last segment with Delta for us and effectively communicated to the crew in JFK to assist us and they did! They offered us a hotel and dinner in EZE. As we missed our JFK connection back to MSP they put us up in NYC and paid for dinner there as well. We turned down the offer for the hotel room in EZE and were able to sleep in the Club Condor Lounge. This is easily better than most First Class Lounges I have seen. Aerolineas in my opinion did much more than Delta United or American would have done for us. Our kids got to spend time touring NYC for the night. Our only downside was the plane could have been cleaner. Sad for a new A330-200. Here the domestic carriers do a better job.

Aerolineas Argentinas,2,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,26th August 2014,False,I flew MIA-EZE-MIA round trip on Aerolineas Argentinas (AeroA) December 24 2013 returning January 7 2014. I bought the ticket online but their website is not set up to allow you to select your seat. So I called their 800 number in the US. I called for 3 days several times each day before someone answered the phone. This agent's English was so bad it took 20 minutes to select my seats. EZE airport check-in at Buenos Aires is chaos. On AeroA all passengers for the MIA flight stood in a single line to be checked-in for only that flight. The same for other flights. We found this out by asking other passengers what to do as there were no AeroA employees or announcement boards present. There were long long lines of passengers snaking through the terminal. Check-in was so slow we were concerned we would miss our flight even though we arrived 2 hours early. It didn't matter though because our flight was delayed 3 hours on a crystal-clear morning. When we arrived at MIA 3 hours late the AeroA gate agents had gone home and there was no one to help us with rebooking our connections to Chicago. The planes both ways were run-down and old on the inside. On the way down a ceiling panel rattled the entire 9 hours. The entertainment system did not work either direction. The flight attendants only appeared 4 times in 9 hours: to serve drinks after takeoff to serve and collect dinner serve and collect breakfast and hand out immigration and customs forms. My advice: 1) Do not fly Aerolineas Argentinas for any reason even if you have to change your travel plans to avoid them or pay more on another airline. 2) If you are unlucky enough to use them and have to fly out of Buenos Aires EZE airport arrive 3 hours early and prepare for the slowest and most disorganized check-in procedure you have ever experienced. 3) If you do not speak Spanish then you will receive only limited customer service on the phone and their web site is primitive. 4) Prepare yourself for old tatty airplanes with no working entertainment system and largely-invisible flight attendants.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,no
Aerolineas Argentinas,1,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,29th July 2014,False,Travelled from Madrid to Buenos Aires in May as the starting point of my South-American holidays. Reasonable prices and a remarkably good service all along the flight. There was a wide range of food to choose including delightful Argentinean beef. Check-in was fast and simple and the flight had no delays at all.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,yes

Still there are delays and poor customer service on the ground. But on board there are new and comfortable planes and nice and attentive FA.

Aerolineas Argentinas,3,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,22nd April 2014,False,I always fly American Airlines first class in my trip JFK-EZE-JFK. I decided to try the business class (club condor) with Aerolineas Argentinas. I regret to says that the business class of American Airlines is much better. The seat at the club condor are ok not flat bed but ok. We were welcomed with orange juice a cheap champagne and candies. The menu says only one appetizer (no choice) and 3 main courses. Two options are for the breakfast time. The whole experience with the catering was horrible. From the presentation to the quality the food did not respond to a business class. Do not expect to have any cocktails since they only have wine beer and whisky. The dessert was a piece of rock (ice cream) and we received hard croissant and bread in our breakfast. The returning flight did not even have all three dinner options and the food was horrible as well. I wonder how do they plan to compete with such a horrible presentation. They do not provide you with the custom forms for USA.,,,Business Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,no
Aerolineas Argentinas,1,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,15th April 2014,False,Even though Aerolineas Argentinas has received too many complaints from customers recently my flight from Sao Paulo Brazil to Buenos Aires Argentina on March 1 2014 in Premium Economy Class was great and I have no complaints. The flight was on schedule the flight crew were polite and helpful. Aerolineas Argentinas' premium economy class is the same as most US companies' domestic first class. The seats are J seats very comfortable and the food in this class was also a great sandwich yoghurt and a chocolate muffin. Compared to service in the same route provided by Brazilian companies I have flown and comparing also the price Aerolineas Argentinas Premium Economy class is far better in service and mainly in seat comfort!,,,Premium Economy,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,yes
Aerolineas Argentinas,2,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,14th April 2014,False,MIA-EZE and return Dec. 24 2013 - Jan. 3 2014. A below-average airline. Their website is so primitive it is impossible to reserve seats. Their toll-free number is not manned 24 hours a day astonishing. On our plane to Buenos Aires none of the in-flight video worked for the entire flight. There was a loose panel in the ceiling over an aisle and it rattled the whole 9 hours. The food was mediocre even by airline standards. The flight attendants were businesslike but disinterested. The plane was only about 1/2 full but the FA's were often nowhere to be seen. Our flight back was 3 hours late leaving EZE after a chaotic check-in at the filthy Ezezia airport. At Ezezia you do not stand in one line for all flights and go to the next available agent. Instead there are separate lines for each flight no indication of which line you should stand in and the agents appear when they feel like it. There was no explanation for the delay and no apologies. If you have any other option for flying between the US and Argentina I would take it.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,no

Aeromar,1,"""never fly with Aeromar again""",22nd November 2018,True," Puerto Escondido to Mexico City. Aeromar is usually my airline of choice. On this day they were more than 2 hours late. So by the time I landed at Mexico City, got off the plane, got my luggage and got to the ticket counter of Aeromexico, my next flight was taking off towards Los Angeles. I thought that Aeromexico / Delta would just put me on the next flight. First, they made me visit different ticket counters which took another 45 minutes and at the end said that they couldn't do anything about it and I would have to buy a whole new ticket. The first ticket that I bought online cost me about $125 usd, but now this new ticket to LA cost me almost $300 usd. After I bought my ticket, went to the Aeromar ticket counter, which was in total disarray, and tried to talk with the supervisor. He gave me an email to write to and sent me on my way. Since then I wrote them twice and have received discouraging emails. Yesterday it took me two hours on the phone with them, going through 3 levels of management for them to give me a ""courtesy flight"" worth $80 usd and I still have to pay the tax. I ask them what would of happened if my whole family was with me, we would have spent $3,000 usd? He said that there is nothing that they could do, so much for customer service. So that is why I think I will never fly with them again.  In the old days we had no choice, but now there are 3 more airlines here in Puerto. There it is guys, the reason why I might never fly with Aeromar again.",,Family Leisure,First Class,Puerto Escondido to Mexico City,October 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,no

Only 1 desk agent. Instead of calling people up front for the flight that was going to depart he checked in people for the flight after. Then gave us boarding tickets when the plane was already gone. People waited for 2 hours to find out what to do next. This airline is a joke! We got booked on a flight the next morning resulting in a loss of paid hotel in Mexico city. When we arrived the next morning there were again 50 angry people in line waiting for a flight that Aeromar cancelled and didn't tell anyone. When we finally got on the plane multiple people had the same seat number.

Aeromar,1,"""strongly advise against""",3rd June 2018,True," I paid $365 for a direct flight from Oaxaca to Tuxtla Gutierrez in Mexico. This airlines baited and switched me by canceling the direct flight and they changed the ticket to Aeromexico with connecting flights and a longer trip that I can now by for $158. They would not refund the flight and i unfortunately booked it with Priceline (who has the worst customer service in the known universe), so I received no assistance whatsoever and options that were not properly explained to me. When I phoned Aeromar, I was greeted by a completely rude agent who was less than helpful. I would strongly advise against booking anything with this airlines.

Aeromar,1,"""nothing has been resolved yet""",27th January 2018,True," Ixtapa Zihuatanejo to Acapulco via Mexico City. My 17-yr old daughter had the misfortune to come in contact with Aeromar and the lack of services while she was on route to Acapulco, on December 23, 2017. She had two connecting flights with Aeromar Airlinesone which was delayed and caused her to missed her final flight to Acapulco. The flight that was delayed was Flight 522. This flight from Ixtapa, to Mexico City was delayed fourty minutes and therefore, she arrived late to her gate to board flight 907, to her final destination, which was Acapulco. She was denied boarding, and there was no help from anyone from Aeromar, after whoch was not permitted to board. My 17-yr old, started her holidays stranded in a foreign country, in a busy airport and just left to her demise. I tried contacting the airline, no one answered, I contact which tried to get in touch with costumer service, and the booking agent, was not able as well. What is disgusting, is that not a single of the airline personnel working that night, offered to help, my daughter was just turned away and you did not care, specially, since it was the airline's fault in the first place that she missed her flight. My daughter had a panic attack, was afraid, and I had to sort all this out from Canada. To my misfortune, I had to buy, yet another ticket from Aeromar, for the next day, as well as find accommodations for the night.
